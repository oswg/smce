[socialmemorycomplex.earth](https://socialmemorycomplex.earth) (SMCE) is a project launched by the [Other Selves Working Group](https://otherselvesworking.group) to help seekers in the [Law of One](https://lawofone.info) tradition build deep, spiritually resilient community that can work in tandem with the incoming fourth density energies as we reach harvest on Earth. We believe that the way to best cooperate with the communal nature of our future social memory complex is to create spaces where trust and love can be cultivated. From there, as circles become closer, circles can extend trust to other circles, the so-called "transitive property of trust" articulated by Claire Dartez, working group co-founder. 

So it's not about creating one giant group for everybody, because personalities are not always compatible. It's about finding a place for each seeker where they can grow and learn to trust their fellow other selves. In this manner we intend to foster the coming social memory complex _from the bottom up_, slowly and carefully learning how to shepherd our planet into fourth density as peacefully and consciously as possible.

We have a few simple ways of acting on this mission:

- building tools for community building and maintenance
- offering guides and counseling for creating meditation circles, working groups, etc.
- working towards the founding of a democratically-run, non-profit organization to ensure the longevity of the project
