# Building spiritual community, one circle at a time

[socialmemorycomplex.earth](https://socialmemorycomplex.earth) (SMCE) is a project launched by the [Other Selves Working Group](https://otherselvesworking.group) to help seekers in the [Law of One](https://lawofone.info) tradition build deep, spiritually resilient community that can work in tandem with the incoming fourth density energies as we reach harvest on Earth.

## Resources for Seekers

- **SMCE Forum**: an invite-only community for studying and applying the Law of One to our lives
- **[Organizing Seekers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCN-UKCBY3M)**: a presentation on building spiritual community at multiple levels
- **[The Council for Social Memory](https://councilforsocialmemory.org)**: part of the mission of SMCE is to organize a legal non-profit to help resource spiritual communities and their projects
- **One-on-one chats with seekers**: studying this philosophy can feel isolating at first. If you need a fellow seeker to talk to, we're here.
