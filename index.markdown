[socialmemorycomplex.earth](https://socialmemorycomplex.earth) (SMCE) is a project launched by the [Other Selves Working Group](https://otherselvesworking.group) to help seekers in the [Law of One](https://lawofone.info) tradition build deep, spiritually resilient community that can work in tandem with the incoming fourth density energies as we reach harvest on Earth.

## Resources for Seekers

- **[The Life Instrumental](/blog)**: A blog focusing on Confederation philsophy, especially classic messages before contact with Ra
- **SMCE Forum**: an invite-only community for studying and applying the Law of One as a means to forming community
- **[_(inaudible)_ podcast](https://inaudible.show)**: A podcast about the applying the Law of One to our lives
- (coming soon) **Orbiter**: a video chat app for timed group meditations online, following the way Carla Rueckert ran meditations at L/L Research headquarters
- **[Organizing Seekers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCN-UKCBY3M)**: a presentation on building spiritual community at multiple levels
- **One-on-one chats with seekers**: studying this philosophy can feel isolating at first. If you need a fellow seeker to talk to, we're here.
