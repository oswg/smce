# Blog post body editing

When the user is writing or editing the **body** of a blog post (any file in `_posts/`):

- **While they are writing:** Do not offer unsolicited suggestions, completions, or "you could also…" ideas. Only answer direct questions. Stay out of the way.
- **After they are done:** Style ideas are welcome when they ask or indicate they're finished—e.g. formatting, blockquotes, headings, structure, tone, readability.

This applies only to post content. For other files in the repo (layouts, config, assets, etc.), suggest freely as usual.
