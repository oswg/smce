This Hatonn really hit me because it came up naturally in my reading, and yet it seems to directly align with much of where my current thinking has centered: on the extra-intellectual philosophy of Peter Kingsley as well as the planetary inquiries my circle has made [two months back to Oorkas](https://har.center/2025-05-24/16/oorkas-on-the-path-to-fourth-density-earth) and this weekend to Monka (to be published shortly). It centers on the use of perception combined with meditation to see through the illusion to the reality behind it, and how one gets there through the use of attention. I'll let Hatonn speak for themselves:

> Meditation is a technique whereby the seeker may become more aware of the creation as it truly is. And yet, when you go forth from meditation, it is the world to which you now open your eyes that is to inform your knowledge gained in meditation. For if you have knowledge and cannot apply it, then you have nothing.
>
> But you see, whatever you may see is the creation of the Father. Of course, my friends, many times you have felt within your heart the beauty of many of the creations upon your planet, those things that grow from your Earth—the trees and the flowers—and those animals that are about you. Many times you have felt how beautiful and how wonderful these creations are. And we have said to you many times, note the service that each creation is to the rest; and you have thought this many times.
>
> But my friends, let us go beyond these intellectual perceptions of the creation. We ask you, when you are ready, to take anything that is within your illusion, whether it be a tree or something that seems to be man-made, such as a wall or cloth or something that seems to be dead, such as stone. It does not matter, my friends, what you choose to focus your attention upon, for we say to you that all things are alive. There is nothing that is without creative power and consciousness. Pay attention to whatever you choose—total attention, focused attention—for out of meditation must come the knowledge that you may apply, that all things are truly one, that all is created of love, that all exists through the power of love.
>
> When you can perceive trees and walls and stone as love, then you will have begun to perceive things as they are. We greatly encourage this in you, my friends. For those who are beginning to meditate, it is enough to suggest that meditation will enable them to have an enhanced perception. Yet for those who are seekers of some experience, it is necessary to point further along the path, for the total end of your seeking within this illusion is to perceive the reality behind and within the illusion. And you cannot do this simply by maintaining a reasonable amount of calm, although this is greatly desirable. Your perceptions of all that you see need to become transformed.
>
> The most central creation of the Father within your attention is of course, my friends, yourselves. Each of you is a great treasure-trove that you can observe as a creation of the Father. You can learn much from yourself. In order to do this you must focus upon yourself as if you were a tree or a stone. Not something familiar but a strange and unusual object, to be looked at and understand from a distance, from a perspective gained in meditation.
>
> You are alive, my friends, through the power of love, and your real nature is hidden in the folds of that mystery. As you examine your thoughts and your actions, try to see what you are doing from that perspective. You have much to learn from all that you can see.
>
> …
>
> You are within the creation of the Father, a very small portion of which is your perceived environment. And like all natural objects that have a birth and a death, you yourself, in your spirit, are of this nature in this environment. There is a great, great deal to learn from the creations about you and within you. Picture yourself, my friends, as a seed. It is written in your holy works that the seed depends on the soil for whether it grows or not. Your spirit is a seed within you. All that it will become is already within it. But you must put it in the correct environment. It needs darkness, by which we mean meditation. It needs light and water. It needs space to grow, the space within your life that you make for your spirit.
>
> You must tend it—you must give it the water and the sunlight of your attention. It is good to read books and hear words such as these. And yet, my friends, the sunlight that will truly ripen the seed of your spirit is the attention that you pay to that which is happening to you: the trees that you pass, the people that you meet, the first-hand experiences of your life as you live it. You may make these things, stony ground or well-watered and warm earth, depending on where you put your attention.
>
> You may think it strange that we who are supposedly, shall we say, more advanced than you continue to use the language of simple farmers, shall we say. And yet, my friends, the simplest things are the things that never become foolish. The universe, the creation, operates on the basis of cycles. And the life of your spirit is a bed to be nurtured just as surely as any other garden. As far as we know, that garden never gets beyond the point where it needs tending.
