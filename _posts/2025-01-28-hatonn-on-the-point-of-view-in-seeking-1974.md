I don't have a lot to say about this. I will say that this idea that "we don't live our own life" is very fruitful contemplation. It's very much in line with the other spiritual reading I've been doing, especially the work of Peter Kingsley and the profoundly, scarily transformative potentials involved in really paying attention.

And in my experience, it's the discovery of these different qualities of the ground of our seeking, new elements of subjectivity that help us turn the crystal of consciousness to see another facet, that help deepen our faith and curiosity in a stultifying and enervating third density yellow ray social complex where we all have to make our coin.

> **I am Hatonn**. I greet you in the love and in the light of our infinite Creator. I greet you in fire, in wind, and with the forces of your planet which also greet you. I am at this time not too far from you. I am far above you, and yet I greet you within your heart. For I am all things and I am you. It is my privilege to speak with you this evening. I am aware that you are seeking the truth.
> 
> How hard are you working my friends to live the best life? Are you attacking each moment as if you could wrest out of it spiritual awareness and happy results? This is indeed the approved mode of operation upon your planet, and it is difficult for you who are within the physical illusion to avoid approaching the illusion with this attitude of active competition against an alien environment. My friends, as long as you retain this consciousness that you must exact from an alien universe that which is yours, you will have struggle and difficulty.
> 
> Question yourself as to who it was that accomplished the so-called miracles that occurred within the experience of the master known to you as Jesus. Remember that according to your holy works he did not take credit for this working of miracles, but instead gave full credit to the Creator Who was within him and did the work for him. My friends, this is a great secret. It is a simple change in point of view, but it is centrally important to your understanding of that which is about you. _You do not live your life, my friends, any more than I live my life. You look over your shoulder and the Creator lives your life._ Your consciousness and you learn but if you let that which is within you, which you may call a spark of the Creator, do that which is to be done, all things will come to you naturally that belong to you. My friends, if you were to be completely, unalterably contented, then your existence would then… this illusion would not be very useful to you.
> 
> The point of view of which we are speaking certainly does not give one a perfect contentment. What it does give to one is a means for a [inaudible] each crisis may be accepted, dealt with, and dropped away, in such a manner that those who see you may learn by your example that it is possible to live in an illumined fashion.
> 
> As you meditate, my friends, clarify within yourselves that which you seek and allow yourselves to become aware at this time of the unity of all that is about you, with yourself. Allow yourself to become aware that your environment is one of unity and that that which you seek is completely within yourself. And allow the peace which follows upon this awareness to expand throughout your conscious mind.
> 
> We wish to give you understanding, my friends. This understanding is very simple and it cannot be attacked, nor can life itself be attacked. It comes naturally, without pride, humbly, easy to accept and easy to forget. Yet this understanding, my friends, may lift each of you into the presence wherein you may lift yourself as have we. We do not tell you this in a sense of great pride and achievement, for we are aware that we are simply a step ahead on the path. We tell you this because we wish you to know that this path leads upward and that it is possible to follow it. Accept this understanding, as it becomes natural to you, not before. But we hope that we may, through you and others like you, share this understanding with as many as possible.
