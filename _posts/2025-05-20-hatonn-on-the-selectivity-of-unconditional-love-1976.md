What a curious, provocative title, huh? Well I'm nothing if not a hype man for the Confederation. I think it's accurate, because what Hatonn discusses here is what is actually capable of being loved in that cosmic, total, unconditional manner. It's not our personalities or the details of our lives. All that stuff is a wash, and it does not partake of the purity that calls back to the Creator at all. That is all illusion, and you cannot love something _fake_.

What you can do, and what I find so fascinating and compelling, is to reach _into the illusion_ to find the reality behind it. This is something that Q'uo mentioned recently at the sixth channeling intensive (especially in [this](https://har.center/2024-11-04/19/quo-on-witnessing-planetary-sorrow) session) where the illusion can be leaned into more to find the truth. Instead of trying to block out that which is false and distorted, backing away from it in an escape manuever, one commits even more to it and through doing so find the solid ground of love and faith and unity under the flimsy and insubstantial illusion.

This is the use of the illusion itself on its own terms to bear out its inconsistencies, its contradictions, and thereby testing it so it allows one to narrow down to the reality behind it. And this isn't a matter simply of exertion and skill; it's a matter of a love so full, so unconditioned, so broadly shone upon the screen of the illusion, so _foolish_ that it exposes the underlying reality, the hidden import and value of life itself. And nowhere will this reality be more poignant and readily apparent than when directed at an other self, a reflection of the Creator in whom you can recognize your own individuality and theirs while seeing the unbroken continuity that binds it all together.

Our task is to love so that we can find out what's real: what is real within us, what is real within the world, what is real within each other.

> I am now with this instrument, and again I greet you. When we say, my friends, that the truth lies within you, we say that which is most easily misunderstood by your peoples. And indeed, when the master known as Jesus said, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,” this truth also is most often misunderstood by your peoples. It has most often been understood to mean that we must love each other’s good points and bad points, as you call them, within this physical illusion. That we must love each other’s failures as well as successes. That the truth lies within the illusion.
>
> We do not wish to indicate that the truth which lies within you has a thing to do with your outer covering, shall we say, of deeds and actions. Nor did the master known as Jesus mean to indicate that you must love the outer wrappings of others. What we are suggesting, and what the master was suggesting, is that you penetrate the illusion, penetrate the wrapping of deeds and misdeeds, and discover within that illusion the reality of the Creator, the reality of love. Within you lies the truth. Within you lies love. Within each fellow man lies the same truth.
>
> My brothers, to love another, as we mean it, is to love that within them which is one with that which is within you. To love yourself is not to love the outer wrapping of personality, but to honor and hallow that divinity that you are, which is at your very center. It is not possible to love your neighbor or yourself from a human level. You may have felt that you had failed if you had not loved completely, yet it is the law of the physical Illusion that a “love” will be bound by the law of good and evil. Therefore, there will be successes and failures. Love will not abide within the physical illusion. It cannot. Laws are to be followed, and the law of good and evil, of action and reaction, is unbreakable within the physical illusion.
>
> There is a higher law, my friends, the law of love. Not the human love; that will fail. But the love which you will find at the center of your created being. My friends, you cannot try to love. Only let go of your feelings, and release them completely into the care of the love that created you. It is not expected that, at the human level, you will be able to love as the Creator desires. It is only as those who open to the center of their being that the love within flows through in the physical being, and out into the physical illusion. You may release this from within you just as a person may, on a very dark night, raise all the window shades in his house, so that the light within may pour out onto the world around him. The light within you, my friends, shines brightly. Whether you know it or not, whether you feel it or not, you have such power within you, my friends. You have such beauty of soul, such love, that it is indescribable. Be it known unto you, however, that love abides within each of you. And the power of this love is total.
>
> Have you been operating on this power, or have you been attempting to live out an illusion using the illusion’s terms? Why do you think, my friends, that you are here? Have you not come to the conclusion that you are here to find something out that is obviously shown to be the reality about you? In there any question in your minds but that the routine of your daily life does not express that which you know to be the truth? My friends, let your seeking cease its restlessness. Turn within. In opening yourself to your own center of truth, you open yourself to the infinity of that which it is your birthright to know. That which you need will come to you, if you begin to seek it in a correct manner. The correct manner, my friends, is to know that the truth is within, and then to turn within and ask that that which you need to know be shown to you. 
>
> Perhaps, my friends, you will find truths directly in meditations. Perhaps the truths will occur in your daily life in unexpected ways. Whatever you need, if you are seeking it from the Creator, the Creator will provide. Seek and ye shall find. This is the truth that we state over and over to you. Seek the truth. Seek in meditation.
