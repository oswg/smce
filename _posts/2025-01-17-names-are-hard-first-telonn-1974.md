I encourage dedicated scholars of this material to take a moment to review the first appearance of each contact in the archive. There's often some interesting notes about how the name is prounounced. In this session, we see Carla struggling a bit with this name -- in the archive it's considered contact with "Telonn" but only in retrospect. Look at the first Q'uo in 1986, too -- there's direction on how it is _truly_ pronounced and also intimations that, at least at that time, Q'uo's composite nature was not really perceived.

But the more interesting item in this session is the first mention of _purified emotions_. I addressed this subject at length [on my podcast](https://inaudible.show/episode-11/) but it's interesting how already you can see a link between emotion and the archetypal mind as well as the continuum with thought.

Enjoy!

> I am Teal’onn. This is not quite right. I am Fillonn. I wish to only break in for a moment. I am new to this channel. I am new to this group. I’m new to this planet. I am only learning how to deal with this planet. I am studying under those of Hatonn. I am with the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. I am here to offer what I can offer of that which I am to that which you are. I am here to give to you all of the aid which I possess, of which I possess none, for I am a channel as transparent as sunlight. I only serve to focus the light of the Creator so that another who is seeking may spot this light in a world of murky shadows.

> My friends, I do not know very much about you yet. I am only learning. I wish to say to you with all my heart, my friends, look up. Pay attention, my friends. Every day, every breath is fantastic. Don’t lose time, my friends. Don’t lose consciousness. That which you are experiencing is precious unto you. Horde it and be aware of it. You are experiencing physical existence. This is very precious, my friends. You will not find such intensity possible in other forms of existence. You will not find the ability to experience with such rapidity and such purity those things which you call emotions. Each moment is a moment of adventure and magic. My friends, look up. Pay attention. Do not let these things go by you. Allow yourself to experience each thing that is yours. Allow those things known as emotions within you to mature so that each emotion, my friends, is as pure and true as a living color.
>
> Each emotion, my friends, is indeed like a living color. It may be clear or it may be murky. Those upon your planet seem to be somewhat murky in their emotions. They are attempting to purify their emotions for they are truly the things that survive. They are not actually emotions but you know them as emotions. They are the colors of the spectrum of light. They are consciousness. They are all the Creator. And to experience truly these colors or emotions is to experience truly the Creator, which is the sum of all which there is.
Each expression which you feel may be purified to its complete end or final form. That master known as Jesus upon your planet is a master among many but one whom you are all aware of, I believe. This master had a great ability to experience in a purified form the emotions of which his waking consciousness became aware. You also may do this, my friends, and I urge you to attempt to follow the teaching of the one who is known to you as Jesus. This man maintained an inner contact with his infinite Father and he experienced each moment for that moment and thereby was able to absorb and use the experience which was his reason of coming. He left an example for you to follow. Many others have done the same.
>
> It has been a great privilege to meet you. I am hopeful that I will be able to speak with you again. I hope that in some small way I have been able to share a thought which may be helpful with you. My blessings upon each of you. I will leave you now. I am Teronn. Farewell and love, my brothers.
