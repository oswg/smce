In this session Hatonn addresses the purpose of the illusion: to test our reactions to each aspect of the Creator streaming through It's many guises. Rather than life being a process of avoiding that which knocks us off our center, life is _catalyzed_ by this refusal to avoid, to simply locate the Creator/self in what we experience and greet it with love. As this reaction becomes more automatic, we free ourselves to be more genuinely creative in the moment, identify opportunities that did not previously disclose themselves, and serve more fully.

Now you might respond that this sounds like an intellectual model imposed upon experience, a way to make things theoretical and abstract and distance ourselves from the true affective work here. And that is, in a way, true. But this gets into the purpose of the intellect, as I see it: to provide focus. It need not divorce us from the immediacy of the primal emotions we feel, but it can provide a framing, a context, that allows us to have self-created experiences that ride along with other-self-created experiences. 

What happens to us is often out of our control; how we respond is in our control, but there is a vast gap there. But bridging that gap is what unites us with everybody else on the planet, and the only benefit to consciously understanding this is that we can notice how we focus and give ourselves that option to direct it in novel ways. 

I encourage you to read the entire transcript, as it builds subtly on the information I've included here.

> It is difficult for many of your peoples to understand why it is necessary for such an experience to take place to reach an awareness that seemingly should be reachable any place, at any time. My friends, it is within reach any place, at any time. But it is also very difficult to test the total understanding of this realization in any experience. It is most easily tested in the experience in which you now find yourselves.
>
> This testing, each day, this testing, each moment of time, is automatic, for it is simply your reaction to each experience that is sensed. Each of you has had reactions to experience that were reactions that you now see as foolish. If one is to reach the goal that he desires during the experience, it is necessary that he adjust his thinking so that his automatic reaction to any experience is always a reaction of love and understanding.
>
> This was demonstrated to you by the master known to you as Jesus. He set an example of reaction to experience. If there is doubt within the minds of individuals as to how they should react to any experience, it has already been set down for you by the man known as Jesus. This man was demonstrating how to react. These reactions were not the product of his analysis or intellect. They were automatic reactions based upon a realization that he had accomplished within the same physical illusion that you now experience.
>
> Because of the consequence of individual experiences within the present illusion, it is a much better test than a less dense illusion. The consequences within the illusion that you now enjoy are seemingly of relatively great magnitude. All of this is for the purpose of testing your ability to express love and understanding. Each of the experiences, regardless of how they seem, are simply illusory tests, operating upon you directly to produce an opportunity for you to display your understanding of love.
> 
> This is the only reason for the illusion which you now experience, my friends. If this is the only reason for this illusion, it should be obvious that once an individual is aware of this, that he spend his time in learning to react to each experience with only an expression of love and understanding.
