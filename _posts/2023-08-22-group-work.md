In [69.17](https://www.lawofone.info/s/69#17), those of Ra are answering Don's questions about the danger of misplacing a mind/body/spirit complex into a time/space oppositely polarized to the complex's native polarization. After discussing the nature of free will and why confusion can contribute to such a tragic outcome, they continue (emphasis mine):

> Secondly, that which we and you do in workings such as this carries a magical charge, if you would use this much misunderstood term. Perhaps we may say a metaphysical power. Those who do work of power are available for communication to and from entities of roughly similar power. It is fortunate that the Orion entity does not have the native power of this group. However, it is quite disciplined whereas this group lacks the finesse equivalent to its power. Each is working in consciousness but **the group has not begun a work as a group**. The individual work is helpful, for the group is mutually an aid, one to another.

Later in [question 22](https://www.lawofone.info/s/69#22) those of Ra confirm Don's suspicion that magical rituals designed by a group for their own use can be better than those from other traditions such as the Golden Dawn.

What do you make of this? My first inclination is that, coupled with [Ra's agreement to teach them to be healers](https://www.lawofone.info/s/4#16) earlier, that they were dropping massive hints that the group might engage in more ritual magic, specifically rituals newly invented based on the more streamlined metaphysics about which they were learning. Indeed, those of Ra gave them rituals for beginning and ending contact, clearing buildings of magical charge, clearing negative entities with garlic, etc. 

I get the strong suspicion that there was an opportunity to, through more intensive and intentional magical direction of their native power, create a system through which they might have been more effective in invoking protection. Wondering what others think of this, since I was reading session 69 (nice) today and saw I'd highlighted that passage. The group work thing is very interesting, since by human standards I would argue they were involved in much group work.
