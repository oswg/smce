The [Other Selves Working Group](https://otherselvesworking.group) is proud to announce that, as they reorganize, they are taking what they've learned so far and launching this site to share it as carefully as possible. Our mission is to help others achieve what we have: intimate seeking circles in which trust can be achieved, seeking can be genuinely shared, and magical power can be directed towards service-to-others ends.
<!-- more -->
Our first goal is the creation of an invite-only community platform for seeking. The goal is to have a discussion and sharing more informed by experience, knowledge of the philosophy, and congruency of vibration. **This is the first step, not the last.** In the long run, we hope to be able to provide a toolkit for seekers at any level to be able to start forming community with those with whom they resonate. In the short term, we are going to start where we resonate and then expand out once the center is solid.

I'm also envisioning this blog to be a platform for not only sharing interesting thoughts, insights into Confederation philosophy, and prompts for discussion but also as a way to _harvest interesting private conversations into pieces from which the public can benefit_. In creating a private space, we hope to be able to elevate the quality of information offered outside that space. We want to demonstrate what is possible or disprove it by trying!

If you want to get in touch, reach out. My name is Jeremy and you can email using that name `@` the domain of the working group linked in the first sentence (trying to avoid spam). Happy seeking!
