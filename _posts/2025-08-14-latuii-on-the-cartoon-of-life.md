This is one of the first appearances of the fifth density social memory complex Latuii, here identified as "Lattoo" by Carla. There are several notable passages in their answers to group questions that presage future messages from Ra: the concept of wanderers (or "apple" to use an archaic term in the Confederation lineage), the graduation from second to third density sans any mention of "densities," and a discussion of anomalous zones like the Bermuda Triangle. The final question from the group asks about how to rest and recover one's strength, and it is here that I take my excerpt. It shows a glimmer of the humor that Latuii will be bringing to bear in future sessions, and if Q'uo ever shows a sense of jokiness you now know from which sector of the principle it arises! There's also one of the first mentions of the "light touch" and the relative unimportance of diet details, something Ra recapitulates less than five years later.

> We would suggest a relaxation period before you attempt to sleep. You must be stricter with yourself about putting down those intellectual worries and considerations which the day will bring. It is a matter of never relaxing. This is not good for the physical. With relaxation and meditation, then as you lie down to rest, do not allow thoughts to begin to work through, but instead allow thoughts only of a recreational nature. You must allow your brain and your body to rest. 
>
> Our other suggestion is always good for anyone, and that is to allow yourself to seek the light touch. To allow yourself to remember that life as you know it is a cosmic joke. It is not good to take things too seriously. All of your busy thoughts and all of your worries are, at best, little cartoons. When you pass from this physical existence, you will spend some time laughing and some time crying, and the tears will come because you took things so seriously, that you forgot to laugh and praise the Creator that gave you this marvelous cartoon. 
>
> This attitude is all-important in maintaining the balance that allows you to go through your physical experience learning and also enjoying yourself. We do not give advice as to such things as diet, etc., because it is our firm belief that these details are meaningless. That which you put into the body is an illusion. The good that you get from it is a function of your belief that it will do you good. The harm that you will get from it is also a function of your belief that harm will come from it. Nothing within the physical has power over you unless you allow it to. 
>
> Do as you deem wise, and then remember, as we say, that whatever you do, it is a kind of cartoon. The greatest and noblest and most tragic things are passing fancies, my friends. Accept them for what they are, accept feelings for what they are. All are true, but all will pass. Do not forget to laugh.

Don't sleep on the Hatonn passages earlier in this session either, great channeling from Carla and (I am guessing) Hal Price.

_(Note: here's another area where I feel the spelling LLR uses in their transcripts is incorrect, just like "Auxhall" and "Oorkas." La-too-ee and La-twee aren't too far off from each other, I'd readily admit, but there is a consistent use of the "ooh" dipthong that I like to capture. "Q'uo" was always prounounced by Carla as "kew-oh," for example. It's the kind of matter that only having a textual archive tends to lose.)_
