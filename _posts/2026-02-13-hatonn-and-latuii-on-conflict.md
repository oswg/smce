Reading this session multiple times as I am absolutely stimulated by conflict. We all are: studies show conflict lights up the brain like a slot machine. I run into it constantly on the internet, and the tighter the feedback loop of the interaction, the more catalyst I encounter.

I don't think, however, that Ra's [suggestion](https://www.lawofone.info/s/101#8) to "avoid contumely" means that one should always surrender and fold. Sometimes conflict is necessary, even productive -- recall that Ra suggests even combat has a positive polarizing potential. To me it's about that "unstudied and spontaneous reaction;" if it's truly unstudied and spontaneous, you're not always going to avoid acting on it. But you _can_ heal it. And I think it is in the healing of conflict between two seekers that the friction can be used to warm hearts instead of harden and freeze them. But that's just my take and I'm still learning these lessons actively (see the last post's comment section if you think I'm the perfect teacher).

Also note the date: not only April Fool's Day (so maybe I am not grasping the advantage of the peaceful fool here) but 36 years exactly before Carla's passage out of space/time experience. Judge for yourself, and take my words as just one seeker's imperfect apprehension of the game.

This is two excerpts from different points in the session but they rhyme. Also go read the original and see one of the few Telonn contacts -- I have it on good authority that a channeling circle made contact with them recently!---

> We have not traveled to the end of the rainbow, as you would say. We have not found the pot of gold. We have only found that the road goes on and on and that our companions became more and more loving and the road more and more delightful. And so in your day-to-day efforts to find your road and to follow it, knowing in your heart that good will come of this effort, it is a private effort, not one which you can share, not one which others will understand. So you do not use the symbols that many understand, for we do not speak in the symbols of any race or culture. We do not use the personalities of masters who have incarnated upon your planet, such as Jesus and Buddha and Lao Tse. Although we could do these things, we feel more honest in telling you that there is a road paved with love, designed with love, difficult to follow but full of rewards. It is the road of those who seek the truth. You can believe with all your heart in a master who has incarnated, such as Jesus, or Buddha, or Lao Tse—it has no bearing on the road, for those things which one uses as walking sticks on that road are all acceptable. The road is the same. We ask you, therefore, when you hear religious and philosophical discussions to know in your heart that each is correct, each is right. All disagreements are disagreements, not about the road, not about love, not about the striving for truth, but merely about that stout walking stick which many use to give them confidence. This instrument prays to the one known as Jesus. We find this provincial but acceptable. We accept and love the one known as Jesus, but we call nothing master except the way of the Creator’s which is followed step-by-step in prayer or meditation, day by day.

> There is a question which we would like to answer that has been asked by the channel herself, and we can only say to her that she must always choose the way of love and attempt not to intellectualize but to give. That is the secret to loving. Therefore, if there is a conflict in her life, she must resolve it by loving.

> To love is an activity, even if nothing is done but a rearrangement of an attitude. Therefore, we ask the one known as Carla to consider the foundations of her being, that they are love, the original Thought of the creation, which was love, and the guidance of those which are ahead of her which you may call angels, and that higher self of hers which can help her, of the Creator Itself which is love. There is nothing to which she can turn that is not love. Therefore, ask for help, seek help, and you will receive it, and that help will be in the form of the grace to love, the wisdom to love, and the understanding to love.
