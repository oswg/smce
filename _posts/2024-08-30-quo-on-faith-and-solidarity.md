> It is faith that is the candle you light in this dark canyon. It will not go out; once lit, it will always smolder in some way, no matter if you turn from it. So there is no challenge that can distract you completely, once you have opened your eyes and left slumber behind, as all in this gathering have done. Keep your mind ready through the practices that all of you have been exposed to. That is all that is required. And then, when it becomes too much, learn to reach out to those you trust, and learn to be there for those who trust you. We cannot give you a perfectly balanced equation for the problem of suffering, but we do know that it is your brothers and sisters who will check your work, so to say, and point out with the most precision where you erred in your reckoning. And then, you begin to appreciate what the mystery of the individual is designed to expose to the Creator. And that, my friends, makes the act of acceptance a little easier and a little better of a lesson that doesn’t get forgotten so easily.

> In closing we would offer that this comradeship is also something we stand ready to accept your invitation to. We cannot check your work as those here can, but if you would but call upon us, or any of those guides, helpers, angels that you feel a kinship with when you are in a dark place, my friends, we would be honored to share that with you. For one of the mysteries of the heartache of this illusion is that by sharing it, we lessen it, we redistribute the pain, and in this way, we build a strength. And if you knew the power that this built, you would shudder. So it is a good thing that you are veiled from your total selves. It will not be forever, and the resources are there. Avail yourself through meditation, through contemplation and silence, and let yourself reveal yourself to you. This is how we serve just as much as through action.
