A short one from Laitos, with whom the Richmond circle just made contact yesterday training up a new instrument. Laitos is talking about patience and becoming in the context of channeling, but this excerpt strikes me as applicable to all seeking:

> In order to attain anything which is desired, the realization that it is to become is the initial step that you must take. Yet, you must meet what comes before you time after time, and practice patience, knowing that that which you have desired is in the process of manifesting and in due time, it shall be. We cannot expect whatever we choose to desire to manifest immediately. Yet the more effort which we put forward in the proper areas, the swifter that manifestation shall come into being.
>
> For those who would choose to achieve any of the abilities, remember this: you have within you the abilities. You do not need to look outward for the assistance. Assistance, indeed, is helpful, but the knowledge that it is within you to begin with is of utmost importance. We are all Creators. We have been told this time after time and it is time that we truly realize that we indeed create that which we wish to experience.
