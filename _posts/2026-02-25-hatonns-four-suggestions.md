This is kind of an interesting one not simply because it features Don, but because it features a message coherently coming through two different instruments. You can see how much Don is struggling, and it doesn't help that the recording captures his voice poorly. However, I think it is salvagable and when Hatonn moves over to Carla, we see how the student has surpassed the teacher, indeed.

Hatonn via Don starts out describing how people relate to the mystery of the illusion in varying ways, and then begins to provide some tips on how to navigate. Hatonn transfers to Carla and these suggestions get dialed in and refined:

1. Apply the knowledge you receive. Think of the absurdity and heaviness of the illusion as a training ground for seeing what is true. If you don't experience truth for yourself, you'll always be susceptible to the distortions of translation, be that a model you invent or one you adopt from another. Find out for yourself directly!
2. Find a community so that the discipline you seek can be balanced with support, compassion, and humor by others just like you. This is a crucial step on the path, and it's so crucial that I've dedicated my life to helping others find their people---it's the whole point of SocialMemoryComplex.Earth.
3. The suggestion of finding beauty in the creation is one I'm still working on, but I think the Richmond circle's work in nature this year will help me understand this better. Beauty is a puzzle for me, and I have thought about asking the Confederation about this sometime this year.
4. Detachment and humor on the path is essential. Life and incarnation are absurd because separation is not real, and yet we have to put on these personality masks and go into the yellow ray matrix. Let it be done in a way that doesn't take these personalities too seriously. And Hatonn seems to imply that there is a connection between the "folly of existence," its absurdity and ridiculousness, and that beauty they suggest seeking. 

That last point is the big takeaway for me, and I hope you find something in here for you as well. I'm leaving a lot on the table with this excerpt, including an interesting Telonn visualization.

> The process… the necessary process must occur within an illusion such as yours. This [satisfaction] is completed. It’s impossible for the individual to progress past that point. As I said, unfortunately a large percentage of the population of your planet at this time has made no progress past that point and is, indeed, not to the point of becoming aware of what I would call their situation in time and space. And they concluded… [inaudible]… nothing else is provided… [inaudible].
>
> It is definite. The greatest mystery is unfolded before you in a never-ending array. Clearly [inaudible]… people think… they miss the point for the most part. A smaller percentage is discovering [inaudible]. A larger percentage is still ignoring it. The real self-disciplined does notice the clues and has done something about them.
>
> I have several suggestions: first, become very active in the application of the knowledge you have received about the mechanics of creation. This is a necessity… [inaudible]… be made. Only when this is done can, shall we say, more evidence be provided—the type of evidence that leads closer and closer to a total understanding of that which is true.

> As we were saying, there are suggestions for those who wish to follow the path taken by those who have noticed the clues given them by the Creator.
>
> The second suggestion is that it is very productive to maintain a community of those who wish to follow this discipline together by means of meetings such as yours in as intensive a manner as you can comfortably and willingly fit into your schedules of work and activities.
>
> One candle alone gives off great light in a dark universe, but the power of several of these candles is much greater than the added power. It is multiplied many times, my friends. Therefore, whenever you can, meditate in groups, speak in groups, work in groups along the lines which you feel to be important,

>The word “family” has different meanings among different cultures, but you may think of those who are on the path of seeking as a family. And when you have gone down that path together, washed yourself clean in meditation together, and worked to the limit of your ability to help your fellow man, using the knowledge which you have gained together, then you are by far a closer family than can ever be made simply by means of legal and blood relationships.
> 
> Thirdly, we would suggest an overriding sense of beauty. We suggest this to you because we feel that it will aid you, even if you are not with a group at the time in which you need help. If you could look about you, the world of the Creator would give you beauty each and every time you look.
>
> Fourthly, we ask you, as always, to maintain that level of detachment which ensures that you are as able to laugh at the comedy of life as it applies to yourself, as you are able to laugh at the comedy of life as it applies to others.
> 
> This detachment is a divine sense of humor which will lead you to a knowledge of the oneness of the universe. As you make your errors, so may you laugh and say, “There also am I.” Thus, when you see the same error in others, you may nod and say again, “There also am I.” Thus, we ask you to practice and share what you know, to constantly rejoin and refresh the inspiration that drives you forward by meeting with those of your own beliefs and pasts. We ask you to see beauty. We ask you to be detached from the folly of existence. These things we would suggest at this time.
