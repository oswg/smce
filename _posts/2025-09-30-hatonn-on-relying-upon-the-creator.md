This is a longer session for 70's Hatonn and there's a few different gold nuggets in here among the more transient questions. However, I think this part right at the outset is the most useful to the seeker. When we reflect upon our conduct and our service, we sometimes wish we had done this instead of that, said this instead of that, and this is good catalyst for our future growth. But Hatonn reminds us that there really is only one choice: to _connect with the Creator within us_ or to try to eek it out ourselves. Our human beingness as understood in the illusion simply does not have the resources to meet the moment reliably, and so castigating ourselves for doing the wrong thing---rather than listening to the wrong voice---is a distortion of the true lesson at hand. Good food for thought.

Also see the Q&amp;A for very interesting discussions on the nature of channeling, the different ET contacts' densities of origin, and especially an interesting comment about the arguable godfather of Confederation contact, George Van Tassel.

> We share with you the thought that through others you may see the Creator, and others may see the Creator through you. Yet of yourselves, you cannot give or receive the love of the Creator. It is only through the consciousness of the Creator Itself that you and your brother are one. Of yourself, you cannot do what you wish to do. You cannot depend upon your own resources. Yet you have infinity behind you, the storehouse of talents and power and ability so great that you can never exhaust it. Your cup may always run over with all that you need, if you can but remember whence love comes.
>
> Love does not come from others, nor can you call it from within your own heart. The Creator that is within you, and that exists as your heart and soul, is your link to total and infinite love. Never depend upon yourself. Never shame yourself if you have been inadequate. Know only that you simply failed to ask the Creator, and next time, remember. In this way, you may meet each situation in life as a rich man who has so many assets that he cannot count them. In this quiet confidence, many, many things can be met with love and with graciousness, whereas if you were to analyze the situation in terms of your own abilities, you would say, “I cannot handle this situation,” and, feeling poor in spirit, the situation would overcome you. This is never necessary, for you have all that you need from the Father. Just remember that He gives you what you need, and seek the connection with Him.
>
> It has been written in your holy works, “I have meat that ye know not of.” This was said by the master known as Jesus. And he was speaking of that connection with the infinite storehouse of the Father. Those upon your planet have put value on things that can be measured, and one is considered a rich man if one has a certain measurable amount of certain measurable items. Yet all of these things that can be measured will also rust and spoil and die. And so will your physical body. So seek, each day that you can possibly find the time, for that link between yourself and the fount of all love, and at this fount, refreshed in yourself, you may always be a blessing to others, as you wish to be.
