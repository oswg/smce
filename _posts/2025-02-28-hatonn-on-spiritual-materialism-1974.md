I just ran into this session, and I think it has a fantastic counterpoint to much of the nature of the seeking we engage in. To the extent that such seeking draws us closer to the mystery of unity, it's all great, of course, but there is friction in the intellectual elements that we consider part of the philosophy. Because these details draw concentration and attention, they influence awareness, holding the danger of distraction and dogmatization. Remember [what Ra said](https://www.lawofone.info/s/52#11): "Always begin and end in the Creator, not in technique."

Now, I don't think this means that all focus on technique is necessarily bad or negative; it's simply a matter of emphasis, much like [their advice on transient information](https://www.lawofone.info/s/26#36). For between the beginning in the Creator and the ending in the Creator, there is a _lot_ of space, and this space is explored as an art that perhaps requires the concentration of awareness on the mundane technique at times. I suppose the main point is to not forget the why of it all, huh?

(Just a note: while the instrument here is unknown, it strikes me as almost certainly Carla. First, there's not a lot of female instruments, ever. Second, it just sounds like her!)

> My friends, we can only tell you that the very idea of density and category and the colors of the rainbow, each of those categorical functions that the human mind so values, is a trap and a delusion in the spiritual sense. We cannot put it any more gently and have you understand what we mean. You have to understand that your categories are occupants of this illusion which you now enjoy, which you have enjoyed since your physical birth and which you will cease enjoying upon your physical death. There is absolutely no harm in understanding the categories with which you must cope within the illusion. However, to allow this to seep into that which you know as your spiritual form is to allow a crippling influence, a halting and blinding influence, to encroach upon your search for the source of life within you.
>
> Our understanding, my friends, is that all things are one. Nothing could be simpler than this understanding. To ask for ramifications, categories, colors of the rainbows, densities or any other list of characteristics is to attempt to impose illusion on reality. Reality is not a process, reality does not change. That which is light, simply is. It is neither active nor passive. It occupies no paradoxes. The beginning and the ending are disunity. At the end of the physical lies all eternity, and yet, eternity implies a process, an endless process.
>
> My friends, this is true, for there are many other lessons to be learned, many other categories to be understood, as you grow closer and closer to that which is your beginning and your end. For it is our understanding that there is a point at which eternity itself is no more. And in the eyes of one who truly understands, one simply becomes that which is. Becoming is done. The circle is complete. Unity is truly known. It is possible to move closer and closer to this understanding through meditation. We are pleased with this group in that its group desire is aimed largely towards an understanding of the metaphysical. Therefore, we may give you information such as this. It is our desire that we are able to give philosophical information. For information such as this is of the higher type, whereas information on such things as density and other categorical questions are lesser in their importance to your spiritual journey.
