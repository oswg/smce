There's something [mentioned](https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=conditioning&amp;st=phrase) during contact with Ra that isn't explained very well. It's a relatively important topic when considering the nuances and mechanics of the Confedeartion tradition of contact, however, and it links Ra with the fourth and fifth density contacts in the 70s: the concept of the _conditioning wave_. 

Here Laitos gives an explanation of the conditioning wave they send. It is an experience that all of the new instruments with whom I've worked have noticed -- in fact, especially at the last intensive I noticed the new folks were a little freaked out by it. I was able to show them how standard it was for all instruments in our tradition, and I think it was as great a comfort to them as it was to me. Sadly, this topic wasn't mentioned in my training with L/L Research even though it holds a high degree of prominence in the archives -- probably because the last living connection with these earlier experiences passed with Carla.

From what I've seen, it's usually some sort of subjectively significant feeling of energy or force: for me, in my first contact with Q'uo, it was like a piledriver into my forehead (along with Q'uo via the preceding instrument in the round robin channeling telling me exactly what I was feeling at the time!). But it's different for everybody, and it's designed to give you an indication that, whatever the phenomenon of contact consists of, it is real and present.

The conditioning wave almost always limits itself to the instrument's notice once or at most a couple of times in the early working, as far as I've been able to tell. It doesn't usually persist too much in one's continued service as an instrument because the whole point of being a good, balanced instrument is to roll with these feelings, to have them _not_ be noticed relative to the information communicated through the wave. So usually it is just a single experience or couple of experiences right at the outset of one's service that give one a nice "attaboy".

Here's Laitos on the matter:

> I am Laitos. I greet you, my friends, in the love and light of the One Who is All. It is my special privilege and duty to give you the conditioning wave, if you desire it. For the benefit of the newer members of this group we would like to speak a few words about the conditioning wave before we begin.
> 
> That which we deliver through these channels to this meeting is sent upon a certain type of vibration. This vibration is of a certain characteristic pattern which, as you have said earlier in conversation, is much like the tuning of one of your electronic instruments.
> 
> The conditioning wave, as we call it, is the blanket vibration of a spiritual nature which carries all communications through the instruments. It is accompanied by the impulse, which when correctly received, may be translated into various movements which indicate actual contact between us of the Confederation and you upon the surface of your planet.
>
> For those of you who wish only to experience the spiritual vibration, this conditioning wave is useful. And for those who are interested in becoming what is known as channels, the conditioning wave’s functions are two-fold: first, to strengthen the spiritual vibration which will carry our thought impulses; second, to exercise the physical being which houses the instrument, so that the instrument will be quite sure that we are actually transmitting thoughts and are not a figment of your imagination.
>
> I will therefore, at this time, offer the conditioning wave to those who desire it. If you will relax and avail yourself, we will make our presence felt. I will leave this instrument now, and greet each of you. I am Laitos.

I'll also mention this Hatonn which speaks to the diversity of feelings that can occur when being conditioned. It is very individual, very subjective, but something that the person can't believe he or she made up.

> The conditioning wave, my friends, is sent in a blanket wave. Some physical vehicles are attuned to accept the conditioning wave in a certain way so that it shows up immediately as certain feelings of energy. Others may not experience immediate sensation yet they too are receiving conditioning and their physical vehicles are becoming more closely attuned to the conditioning wave. There are many reasons why some people experience variations in the conditions however it is sent and it is received. There are varying lengths of time necessary in individual cases for the conditioning wave to begin to manifest in the manner recognizable within the physical illusion as conditioning, as you call it. We are, however, satisfied that the wave is doing its work as we see each individual who is seeking the conditioning making progress towards a full ability to receive the wave in its most efficient form for producing instruments. This is, of course, only given upon request.
