This is the only appearance of Orkan in the archives. Since there's a superficial similarity between their appellation and Orcas's ("Oorkas" in our material) it's possible there's a connection, but I find it unwise to dwell on these things too much. The names are much much more important to us than they are to these contacts.

Not a lot I want to add to this message; really the thing that sticks out to me is the "discipline to seek the flame" part. It seems like an alternative rendering of "finding the love in the moment," but one that perhaps improves slightly on Ra's phrasing to the extent that they are able to speak much more broadly about love using this metaphor of the flame. I find that the true scope of cosmic love--a love encompassing destruction and creation--is better captured here. Passages like these show the power of which these contacts are capable, especially relative to the other contacts in the session.

> I am Orkan. And I speak to you this evening for the first time. It is an infinite pleasure to me and I greet you in the love and the light of the One Who is the Creator of us all.
>
> I am a flame. I am a flame that flickers, my friends, that glows, that grows, that is eternal. I am the flame of creation; the flame of your physical sun that warms your planet and allows your food to grow on your fertile land. I am the flame of destruction that transmutes all that there is. Yes, my friends, I am a flame. I appear as the love in the heart of those who give. I appear, my friends, as the intelligence of those who think. I am the flame that creates beauty, whether it is the beauty of the Creator or the beauty of mankind; the beauty of your art or your music; the beauty of your architecture, of your statues, of your philosophy. I am a flame that may but flicker in the darkest of times, my friends. I am to be found by those who can recognize love.
>
> I am and you are the flame, my friends, the flame of love that burns and consumes. It is not something that you reach out to find. The total freedom, the total annihilation of fire is not something that you may use, my friends. Love can only use you. It is not a tool, my friends. You are the tool for love. You have not chosen a gentle path. You have chosen the path that consumes those things about you which are not love. The rate of that consumption is completely dependent upon you. When do you wish to become the flame of love, of joy, of light, of laughter, of freedom? It is up to you, my friends, for the flame is always there inside you, inside me. My friends, the flame is not an answer. For as far as we know, we have no answers. We have only the process of love. We have only the knowledge that the flame, that the love is grace, is easiness, is strength.
>
> If you have the discipline to seek the flame in moment, whether it be in the day or the night, in joy or sorrow, in something great or in something very small, if you have the discipline to seek it, then you become the flame. And when you have achieved this identity, this manifestation, it is not, my friends, that you become a teacher, it is only, my friends, that you become a window through which the flame can be seen.
>
> I am Orkan. It is a great privilege to meet each of you, and I and my brothers are with you. Adonai vasu. Adonai.
