We've reached the last documented session of this amazing year, 1974. Hatonn takes a moment before answering the groups admittedly transient questions to distinguish the meditative approach to oneness with the intellectual acceptance of it. Meditation, in part, is a way in which this oneness becomes a reality instead of just a theory we "believe in."

However, this oneness is not just a feeling that precipitates into the meditator over time. Crucially, this unity of all consciousness is precisely at the heart of the channeling phenomenon to begin with. We are channeling _now_, and when we channel Hatonn or other Confederation entities, they are giving us words that they _themselves_ are channeling from higher up. Channeling, in summation, seems to be just the way information circulates through the densities and sub-densities.

This insight has been indispensible in my work on a general theory of channeling, where I'm hypothizing that channeling is inherent in all thought and that it's simply a matter of which densities or sub-densities are being bridged at a given moment, not a question of whether it's occurring or not. So we're all channeling all the time anytime there's "motion of thought;" it's just a matter of which density boundaries we're moving between. Most of the time we stay in a tight band of sub-sub-sub-sub-densities; with work and concentration, we can dilate that band and cross major densities. 

Remember: [infinity has a center](https://www.lawofone.info/s/82#7); though we can get lost in the sheer endlessness of it, there's a return point always available when we dilate our focus and [expand into oneness](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofone_philosophy/comments/1j08oew/hatonns_meditation_technique_1974/).

> I would simply like not to let the opportunity pass to remind you, my friends, of the unity of all things. Meditate, my friends, upon the complete unity of yourself and all that you see. Do this not once, and not simply in present circumstances, but at all times and especially in difficult circumstances. For, my friends, insofar as you love and feel at one with those things which are difficult for you, to that extent will those circumstances be alleviated. This is not due to any laws within our physical illusion, but is due to the law of love. For that body which is of spirit, which is interpenetrated with the physical body, is higher than your physical body. And those changes which you make by love upon your spiritual body, will, of necessity, reflect themselves within the physical illusion.

> All is one, my friends. My voice is now the voice of this instrument; my thoughts are her thoughts. Please believe, my friends, that the vibration we offer you is not a vibration of personality, but is a vibration of the Creator. We are also channels. There is only one voice. Within this vibration, we are self-consciously aware that this voice is the voice of the Creator. It is simply a matter of lifting vibrations which are not so self-aware of the Creator. That, too, is spiritual vibration, and all things will eventually come into harmony in relation to your understanding.

> Even if the universe for those around you remains disharmonious and difficult, if your mind is stayed upon the unity of the Creator, your own universe will become harmonious. And this is not by your doing but by the simple love of the Creator.

> Meditate upon this, my friends. It is not an easy lesson. And it will require a great deal of meditation, before the practice is as easy as the intellectual acceptance.
