Don't let the policy wonkish title fool you. Hatonn in this excerpt addresses the conundrum of education at scale, where unique individuals are fed a one-size-fits-all curriculum but where individual instruction simply doesn't scale. The real solution is the dissolution of the veil and the ability to see the fullness of an other self, but that's of no help to our institutions presently! And I'd wager this question might be informed by the Louisville folks paying attention to the work of Richard T. Miller and the Solar Cross Foundation, who posed many questions to Monka about how things like this work in higher densities. I hope to share more excerpts from their work this year.

I would just point out before I log off that Hatonn really does pose this conundrum to the reader as a choice more generally. Is it better to serve in the way you can right now, the way that makes sense given your read of the problem? Or is it better to dive in and help as one can, recognizing the dangers of one's imperfect understanding of the others' need? This is the old problem of service in front of the veil once again, rearing its head in the educational variety of service.

While this session gets cut off, I think it's clear where Hatonn is going: that the _intention of service_ is the most important spritual element. How do we act in a way that brings that cosmic, all-embracing love and our highest ideals into manifestation? Since all manifest service will entail a kind of collapsing of the infinite idealism that constitutes the intention, one must perhaps learn how to make one's peace with that. After all, an instrument does not judge its user's work, does it? It simply yields to its will.

> **Questioner**: I would like to know if you can tell us anything about the educational systems and how they will be changed in the future? _[inaudible]_ but we need to know at this time.
>
> I am aware of your question. When we receive a question which involves the free will activities of those who apply their wisdom and their knowledge in an effort to improve the lot of life for those upon their planet then we must needs fall back on the principle of freedom of choice. Therefore we cannot say to you what would be the best way, for it is your planet, my sister. And you deal with those things which are known to you as limitations as well as those things which are known to you as ideas. And in this dense and chemical atmosphere, it is necessary for you to know in your heart and think out with that fine tool which is called your brain what will be the best way to serve your peoples.

> You know that the great principle of love is the heart of all learning. And that all those souls who breath the atmosphere of your planet come with a certain degree of wisdom and desire to learn that is unique to them. It is therefore extremely difficult to form a system of education which is comfortable and beneficial for all. Thus you must always decide whether you wish to perfectly educate the few or gradually and imperfectly educate the many. Without the understanding of each parent that the child is a spirit born in love, without the understanding of each parent that the center of life is in appreciation of the force and the beauty of life and the love that creates it, education becomes an artificial and difficult matter instead of the joyful and spontaneous flow of information gladly asked for and gladly given.

> Without mind to mind understanding it is impossible to know the great uniqueness of each soul. It is impossible to respond to the great uniqueness of each student. And so you are where you are in an arena in which those things which are true in the highest level must somehow be brought down to practice in an atmosphere in which truth can not prevail perfectly. We ask you, my sister, shall it be better for you to refrain from aiding because you cannot be perfect or shall you go forth, armed in love, and use those things which you know and those abilities of mind that you have worked upon in this incarnation and do what you can knowing that while it is imperfect…
