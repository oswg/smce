There's a really good excerpt from this session I'm leaving, possibly to deal with in a more comprehensive way tomorrow. However, this is a good and rather concise explanation of reincarnation by those of Hatonn which I think bears reading. It really gets into the affective dimension of what kind of self we must be to contain this kaleidoscopic capacity for expression of our essence.

The challenges with which we are dealing _right now_ are the stuff of the incarnative/discarnative sine wave our consciousness traces in its undulations through time and space. We have accrued biases that give us things to work on in order for our consciousness to expand and our ability to love be less and less inhibited. The details of personality are but a kind of avatar or container we've selected for understanding our full 360 degrees of self in _this_ context at _this_ time. Karma, far from being some debt we learn to refinance cleverly, is instead our best friend in ensuring this learning. Consider applying that rubric to all of the elements of incarnative life that we attempt as best we can veiled from our total selves.

The point I'm trying to make---the point I see those of Hatonn making---is that this total self beyond our current, past, or future personalities is the real project. Who we are in this life is but a shadow that learns bit by bit how to step out of the way of the light, but _that light is the subject of interest_. The more we can understand our incarnations not in terms of the triumphs and traumas, beyond the historical context or personal dramas that shape egos, but instead as means of conveying our essence into an "incarnative experiential nexus" such that transformation and growth can occur, the more we can tune into the deeper learning. This is how we make our peace with death and thereby live lives _now_ that aspire to fulfill the promise we held when we originally programmed them.

> We will attempt to explain to you the reason for a lack of memory of past experiences. Though it is not an easy concept, you must realize that you are not helpless but are, instead, a person of free will with the opportunity to meditate and to seek the kernel of love that lies within you at this time.
> 
> In previous existences, the experiences that you have had have generated within you certain biases. Thus, some people are born with native love, and others without it; some with native goodness, and others without it; some with great native intelligence, others with very little; some with great talent, others who seem quite ordinary.
> 
> These biases form the personality which you bring into this world. But other than that, you have the opportunity to begin wherever you are and become a loving being. This is the only test upon your level.
> 
> If you knew all that you have done before, your mind would be attempting to carry you through all of the lessons you had learned before. This is too much for the mind to deal with. It is enough that you have this incarnation to deal with. The fruits of former incarnations dwell within your spirit.
> 
> Again, we go back to meditation. If you have a difficult relationship or a difficult concept to conquer, meditate and request that light be given to you upon this subject. When you can say, “I have no past, and I have no future, but at this moment I hate no man. I love all beings and all those with whom I may have any score to settle, those things I have settled with,” at this point you are beginning to be able to pass the great test of this vibration. It is a difficult one, and it is to show love in the darkness when you seem to be by yourself, not knowing that, in reality, those who love you on other planes of existence are all about you. Those who love you in this life but cannot speak are, without words, supporting you. All these things you cannot know; but, above all, you cannot know by mind alone that which must be given to you by direct intuition of the truth—the one simple truth, my friends, that we are all one and that we must love one another. Many of your masters have spoken to you of this, and we can only repeat it. It is the only lesson worth learning.
> 
> Past lifetimes? They are a kaleidoscope; they are you. But so are your future lifetimes. Imagine yourself as part of a great circle where consciousness dwells within this part of it at this time. But all that you must do at this time is meditate and seek the love of the Creator. And then, when you have it, send it forth. As we have said, this is not an easy concept.
