This is interesting, and I don't have any comments.

> # The Guardianship of Earth
> 
> _(Richard channeling)_
> 
> Greetings, Oh Children of the "Light." **I am Hatonn**. It is my great privilege to speak at this time on a subject which I would like to call, The Guardianship of Your Planet.
> 
> As you are aware, the planet Earth occupies a unique position at this time in the history of your Solar System. It was necessary for my being to travel to the planet Mars in order to address you at this time. Fortunately, certain records were available to me, and from these, I believe, we may present a more interesting sidelight to this entire topic.
> 
> People of Earth, knowing of this great truth: that your planet does not reside alone in the Cosmos, it should be apparent that there is a great purpose even in its existence. I have mentioned that your planet had a great heritage to experience. I would take this opportunity to discuss this.
> 
> At the time of early life upon your planet, the original inhabitants were gifted with amazing powers and abilities and were subject to various forms of environmental conditions; to certain qualities peculiar to the planet Earth's own vibrations.
> 
> Due to the subtle workings that you have encountered in many of your religious works, it is apparent and well known that a great darkness descended upon your people. However, there is always the eternal purpose of our Creator, which states that on planets with positive evolution, the "Light" will always dispel darkness, no matter how intense.
> 
> So, your infant races overcame their liabilities and started again on an upward progression. Soon, it seems that certain forces (alien intervention) entered into the environment of your planet and created conditions of a chaotic nature. These led again, unfortunately, to conditions which caused a great conflict among two of your ancient races, known as Atlantean and Lemurian.
> 
> Since, as I have mentioned, the forces causing this conflict were alien to your planet, it was decreed and ordered that all of those who had not totally undergone a disintegration of that known as spirit and character, should be removed to other inhabited planets within this Solar System and others nearby. There was a great evacuation. You may reference it in time, and may find a rather vague account in which much meaning is hidden in archaic language and stilted symbolism; in the account of a "great flood" and a ship carrying the survivors of all known life. (Hatonn is referring to the legendary account of Noah and the Ark. However, he is placing this event, in time, following the destruction of Atlantis and Lemuria. This implies that our current historical theories regarding this event are incorrect regarding the time of the "Great Flood.")
> 
> Due to the conditions which existed upon your planet for a considerable length of time, those ones who had been partially touched by the alien brain control forces but who had managed to survive, migrated to various areas throughout your world; some to the region you know as your South American continent, while others went to those places known as Asia and your Far East.
> 
> Again, a long progression started upon its upward trend. The results are those that are visible about you at this time. In the past, due to the nature of our galactic laws and those codes we live under and by, our Confederation has been allowed merely to observe and aid in small ways, the people upon your planet.
> 
> Our main concern and one of our chief duties is to see that those forces, which were alien to the Earth, are not allowed to consummate any further activities that would be considered detrimental to your evolution. Your people failed once (the period of the great abomination) in its upward climb. This second failing was not considered to be your fault nor of your doing. There shall be no third time, people of Earth. Many who hear or see my words will come to realize that all may change upon your planet. It is to undergo a great change. However, you are not unique. All planets in this Solar System are undergoing similar stages of change as even your scientists with their limited views can perceive. The universe is never at rest. It is constantly in movement. One unique characteristic of this drifting movement is that a Solar System constantly encounters new areas of space. This is true of planets, solar systems, galaxies, and of the universe as a whole.
> 
> This entire planetary system, from which I address you, is undergoing great change brought about by many forces. It is no longer a question of our accepting a policy of non-intervention, as such a policy is now being changed. It is a question now of accelerating the rate of progress, of evolution, of enlightenment, of your planet, for even its physical substance must be awakened to a greater degree, as well as its inhabitants. It will not be possible for the rest of this local stellar evolution to complete its cycle, with the other planets concerned, and the neighboring systems in this corner of our galaxy, if the planet Earth does not proceed with it. We may not lose a portion of creation in order to progress. All must undergo the experiences of this change. Our Infinite One in Divine Enlightenment has so expressed His purpose. Therefore, people of Earth, we take great interest in your planet and your people.
> 
> We have many motives for wanting to aid you. It is entirely right that you know some of these motives are a question of necessity. However, there are motives far greater in number which are these things all of us of the Confederation hold dear. A certain memory perhaps, an obligation, a sense of that which is just. Many could be enumerated. All of them though, explain why your planet is indeed in a unique position.
> 
> We progress together, our brothers. No one will remain behind. I trust certain of my thoughts have reached the minds of many and that a greater degree of that called understanding and awareness will encompass and be a part of your newfound consciousness.
> 
> Your planet receives a great deal of this Love, called understanding, called "Light," from many different locations and sources within our universe. Many great Ones have lent their abilities, their talents, their very beings, in mass, to accomplish that which our Creator has expressed.
> 
> Therefore, we of the Confederation now feel that we are called upon to openly greet your peoples -- to awaken in them an awareness of that which is. The changes that will necessarily ensue will be in the "Light" of Our Infinite One -- they will be correct ones. It is with all humbleness and with great love in our hearts that we do this great work.
> 
> Now, you have before you a rather interesting concept; one which contains many truths. It is up to you, people of Earth, how you will accept this, how you will act upon it. To those who sense a far off and yet near glimmering of a Radiance which knows no color, let your minds be opened -- let your hearts unfold. Lift up your arms and encompass that which is all.
> 
> This ends my little talk at this time. Perhaps, my brothers, we will find even more to talk about as I know that the time again draws near. We have long waited the opportunity to speak with and greet the people of Earth.
> 
> Adonai. May the Love and the "Light" of The Infinite One be with you. May all peace be yours. I am Hatonn. Adonai. ☥
