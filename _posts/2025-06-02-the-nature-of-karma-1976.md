Welp, this is a rare one: an unidentified contact. Since Carla is channeling here, it's almost certainly Hatonn. This entire session is extremely packed with good information on channeling, but I wanted to call out this exchange on karma because it gets to a topic my circle has been thinking about.

There's no doubt that Confederation philosophy considers outward, phenomenal reality to be the instrument by which we learn about ourselves, providing opportunities for catalyst and transformation. However, part of this learning seems to involve _applying the learning back into the illusion_. I understand the function of a quiz in education, but normally that's designed to prove to an authority that we learned what they taught. It's not designed for us to prove anything _to ourselves_ as students.

There's something about our willingness to live according to the lessons we learn that certifies them as truly learnt. Up to now, statements such as this one from Monka have been my understanding:

> You see my brother, it is in the application of the full self that the lesson is learned, and we point this out to this instrument, for intellectually figuring things out, so to speak, has very little value. But demonstrating, pouring your love into the moment in a way that represents that moment’s reflection of the truth: now you have something that you can take home and show your parents, and that report card will get signed, so to speak.

It's like a kind of commitment of faith to the lesson: let's go back to the confusion and see if when confused you still understand the lesson. Let's see _how much you want it_.

I've never considered the role of karma in all of this, which really: karma is just an alternative model to the didactic model addressed above. If karma is more of the material illusion -- which in and of itself is an interesting idea -- then it's easy to see how action in the illusion would arrest the momentum of a lesson.

So maybe it's just that we learn these metaphysical lessons, and these unlearnt lessons manifest at different levels, one being the outward illusion. Perhaps one way of thinking about it is that the spiritual/inner work wears down the lesson enough that it can be knocked over in the illusion. Once dislodged, it no longer features in the illusion.

> *Questioner*: Yes, please.

> *Unknown contact*: There is a law within the density which you now know as the physical. This law is visible within the physical illusion as cause and effect. There is no action without a reaction. Nothing that happens has not been caused. That which you do is reflected in experience. This is karma.
This is a law. The law does not become abrogated. There is a higher law, and this is the Law of Love. If you invoke this law, this law will dissolve the karma. Yet you invoke this through action. In meditation, you align yourself with all that there is. You have brought into your consciousness the Creator. Yet karma is that which is in the physical, and to dissolve karma, there must be action of a final kind which resolves the reaction. This action partakes of love, but love-in-action.

> It is as though you would say that there was a fire, raging out of control. And you stood by it, and you said “What is this destructive thing? And how do I manage to overcome it?” And as you meditated, it came to you that you would overcome fire with water.
>
> And there you sit in meditation, with a pail of water in your hand. But, my sister, you have not put the water on the fire. Go from the meditation with the understanding, and put out that fire. Do it consciously, and know that the law of love is overcoming the law of karma.
