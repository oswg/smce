The last recorded session of 1975 is a real treat, one of those sessions where you find something right at the outset that's worth sharing here, and reading further only gives you better and better excerpts. I feel like the point of these little posts on reddit is to give as encapsulated a bite of inspiration and teaching as possible; I could post the whole thing, but you can already find that yourself!

Anyway, Carla often stated spiritual pride was her biggest hangup. To label humility as itself a stumbling block must have struck her conscious mind as curious at best. This is where we see the cosmic outlook of the Confederation tugging at Carla's Christianity, coaxing her to see things in a more nuanced manner. In truth, her personality -- everybody's personality -- is not a fixed thing, but a dynamic tension between opposing qualities.

Life is a tightrope, and balancing act between being the instrument in the world and the Creator using the instrument. The only way to stay on top of the rope is to let go of what is making you fall. Errors are only irredeemable if the personality that fashioned them is more permanent than the soul using that personality.

I left out the part at the end where Hatonn names the best tool for us to find this balance, because it's not going to surprise you at all. :)

> My brothers, look at each other, and, for the first time, truly see the very best within each other. Within the one known as Jesus was a sight which was of love. Those who were about him could be described in rather unfavorable terms. Those whom he loved could be described as harlots, tax-collectors, publicans, beggars; there were many sick and crippled. And in no case did the one known as Jesus see them as anything but the Father, the Father who was directly before him on the physical plane. He looked with love. He saw the possibilities within each of his “fallen” friends. To the sinner, he said, “This day, you will be with me in paradise.” My friends, these things are familiar to you, and so I use this channel, and this mode of discussion, as a good example. There are other masters, and they have showed this Creator-within in other words. But we believe that it is through this example that you will most easily understand what we are saying to you. We look at you, and we see the light, we see the perfection, and it is our delight to be in communication with you.

> It is very possible for you to become one with this vibration. And, my friends, this vibration of love, this vibration of compassion will transform your life into that of the Kingdom of Heaven. It is a matter of balancing between two opposite attitudes in your seeking. There are two dangers, and we [say] this with a sense of humor, for the dangers are not real. It is the balancing between them that causes your progress. These two dangers, my friends, are pride and humility. Woe be unto the man who begins to feel that it is his love that is setting those about him on the path of light, that [it] is his compassion that is such a light to others. Woe be unto this man, for the love of the personality is limited. It will run out, and in its wake will come much sadness.

> Woe also to the person who says, “I am unworthy. In my humility I must admit I cannot be a fit channel for the love of the Creator. Do not expect me to keep trying the impossible, for I am not worthy, and I cannot do this.”
>
> In neither case, my friends, have you quite hit the balance. And if you find yourself in either the pride or the humility, balance between confidence and the knowledge of your own imperfections as a personality. You see, both of theme things are true, and neither of them matter. You are a channel through which the Creator may express Himself. The Creator is love, and His expression is love. When you see someone, to your outer eye, he may be nothing but, shall we say, a very common-looking or even unpleasant piece of stone. A large rock, awkward and peculiarly colored. Yet to the eye within, the eye of love, this rock will be the shape which the master may carve from the rock so that it becomes a beautiful statue, a statue with beautiful lines and coloration, with all the potential of that piece of rock set free in beauty of line. People are both their raw materials and the possibility of perfection. It is the Creator Who causes these possibilities to become manifest in the physical world.

>You cannot do it—of course not. You can only say to the Creator, “Please, live this moment for me. Allow my eyes to shine with your light.”
>
> It is to the outer eye a very dark world. Darkness is all about you. My friends, within the darkness, there is light. If you wish to allow it to shine forth, it can never be denied. The light may not light up all of the darkness, but where you are, it will be light, if you allow it to be so. Picture your eyes as windows, and make sure the shades are up, so that the light may shine through. The shades are made of prejudice, judgment, petty feelings and negativity of all kinds. Your personality has been given to you so that you may work these things out. Again and again, you will find yourself pulling the shades down. Always it is the precise moment of now that is important. If you have been in error, simply choose at this moment to release that error, and let the shades up, and let the light shine through. What has happened in the past is completely done with.
