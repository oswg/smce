These are the messages that really intrigue me because of how much of a political theory guy I am. It's what made me fall in love with the complex of Monka: the idea that our social problems are a result of very simple barriers in our hearts, not puzzles we've failed to solve with our brains. This analogy to the body, then, is incredibly instructive.

We are like the first cellular organisms naturalistically discovering how to cooperate sufficient to create a multicellular organism as a result of the upward spiraling light. However, instead of this spiraling effecting body complex formation as a result of the deterministic bumping of molecules and processes of chemical reaction, another complex -- a more _social_ one -- is forming. The nature of this process relies more on refined and abstract mental and interpersonal dynamics, but (this is extremely important) _it is precisely as naturalistic a process_, just one occurring at the level  of mind, spirit, and logoic will instead carbon and hydrogen.

If we looked at the way we relate to one another as that of a cells relating to a body, it would be easy to see our social ills as disease and even, perhaps, recognize what it might take to heal, not as a matter of seizing control of the brain so much as yielding to the instinct of the society to address issues at the level we encounter them, much as a white blood cell doesn't try to take over the body but just kills pathogens as it bumps into them. If this seems politically simplistic, then one wonders what kind of monstrous, Cronenberg-style organism we've created that requires black ops, economic exploitation and manipulation, and an underclass of rotting appendages we call the homeless and the poor designed to scare the rest of the body's cells into submission. Hope that analogy is coherent enough to follow!

> I am Hatonn, and I greet you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. I speak to you as a representative of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. I also speak to you as a voice from within yourself that beckons you inward; not outward, my friends, but inward.
>
> We hover high above your planet, offering what seems to be telepathic instruction from one being to others. But in effect, my friends, that is not true. We are one being—you and I and all that dwells in consciousness—and we speak to each other as an arm speaks to a leg, or as two brain cells communicate in the same entity. Those who are upon your planet speak to each other in such a way that, if you understood that you are one body of consciousness, you would understand that you are like a cancer or a disease to yourself: the entity attacking itself, the entity fearing itself, the entity destroying itself.
>
> In your so-called orthodox medicine, it is understood that when a cancer attacks your physical vehicle, your attempt is to remove it, cut it out, and dispose of it. But, my friends, if your doctors could understand the true meaning of cancer, they would not cut it out but would, instead, reinstruct it so that it would become benign and proper. And this is what we are attempting to do to you. For you are conscious, and all of those on your planet are conscious and what you continue in hostility and fear—one to another, brother to brother, nation to nation—the answer, my friends, is not further violence to cut out those who are wrong. The answer, as always, is love. Love is an atmosphere in which consciousness can be reinstructed in the original Thought.
>
> Within you, my friends, is the wisdom that is totally and completely aware that you are part of a being called the universe. As you look out into what you call outer space, know that within you is the true reality of which outer space is only a picture. Your consciousness, my friends, is an incredible and infinite geography, peopled with an infinity of creatures equipped with the collective wisdom of eons of experience; for, my friends, within some part of your being, some deep and, for the most part, hidden part of your being you have all knowledge, all power, all compassion. It is as they were in files in a room to which you have lost the key.
>
> Do you wish, then, to explore outer space to repair the great damage of your society, or do you indeed think of it as hopeless? Take these attitudes away from the world, my friends, and turn them in to yourself, for you yourself are the great object on which to practice your own wisdom, on which to develop your own understanding. If you can solve those slums which exist within the topography of your consciousness, the slums in your cities will begin to take care of themselves.
>
> You say, “What can one person do?” We say to you: one person can work on one person, but that one person, my friends, is a hologram of all that there is. Your consciousness is all consciousness. Work on it, and you work on your race, your planet—the vibration that speaks for Earth.
>
> We offer you our love and our serenity and encourage you to seek those qualities in meditation. When you are upset, do not blame it upon little things which have occurred in the outer world: blame it on the lack of meditation. When you see your fellow man in a hostile manner, don’t blame it on his actions but on a lack of meditation. Your environment does not have to have any power over you, for all that there is is within you. The environment is only a shadow compared to the power of love within yourself. Meditation can unlock that power.
