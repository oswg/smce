In [49.7](https://www.lawofone.info/s/49#7) Ra refuses to provide Don with a meditation technique. However, their student Hatonn did this a couple of years prior, and I find it very simple and streamlined. If meditation is something that has eluded you because it's simply so unstructured -- and let me be clear, there is great, great value in unstructured, "pure" meditation without object or goal -- this technique of Hatonn's may be something you can work with. I'm thinking I may do an _inaudible_ episode on this just because it's very clean while also offering opportunities for reflection on what meditation actually entails, its meaning in our lives and seeking. 

Do yourself a favor and read [the whole session](https://www.lawofone.info/s/49#7), it's great and a fantastic example of the kind of seeking that led that group to make sixth density contact eventually.

> First, my friends, let us clear our minds as best we possibly can of all thoughts that you may have concerning your daily lives. My friends, let these thoughts of your daily lives drift away, for these are very transient thoughts. These thoughts will be gone in a few days. Let them go now. Let the influence that your material environment has upon your thinking, leave you. Let your mind be clear. Let it be as a child. Do not attempt to understand, do not attempt to understand, my friends, and then you will know. For you cannot understand by a process of trying. You must understand by a process of knowing. Do not try to come to a conclusion. Do not try to analyze. Do not try to utilize past experiences. Simply allow your mind to become clear.
> 
> When this is accomplished, my friends—and we are aware that you may not be able to accomplish this immediately but you may practice this at a later time—when you have done this, my friends, when you have allowed your mind to become clear, to become receptive and as a small child, then, my friends, become aware of yourself. Nothing else matters, simply yourself. Do not think about your thinking. Do not analyze yourself. Do not use the intellectual mind. Simply become aware of your own being. Allow this awareness to grow, to grow from a very clear and unfettered mind. Become aware of yourself and nothing else. Think of nothing else, my friends. Become aware of only yourself surrounded by nothing.
>
> Try this now, my friends. Allow all other thoughts to escape, to be released, to no longer remain in your conscious mind. When you have done this, become aware of yourself, only yourself. Let this awareness of yourself expand. Let your own being expand. Let it move outward in all directions. Let it encompass all of infinity. Let it then know that it, in an infinitely expanded state, is all that there is. It is one in the same with every other thing, with every other experience, with every other particle, in this entire infinite creation. Nothing, my friends, is excluded. Know that you and all are one single being. Do not try to understand this. Simply practice these three simple steps. Clear your mind. Become aware of yourself, and then expand. Feel yourself expanding infinitely, until you touch every other particle in this creation. Then, my friends, you will know your true nature, for this is your true nature.
