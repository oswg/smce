Maybe it's just me and [my recent fixation on thought forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_BOWeM_LUA), but I found this passage from Hatonn quite challenging because I've been proceeding on the theory that sub-sub-logoi are more than just thought forms. Hatonn here suggests that we, or at least our individuality, are projections of the Creator's thought. It's not a direct contradiction of [Auxhall's claims](https://har.center/2025-08-16/3/auxhall-on-thought-forms-and-service) a few months ago, but it does muddy the waters of what thought is and how we go about relating ourselves to the Original Thought and our own thoughts.

However, that's just a nerdy metaphysical detail, one that perhaps we are not positioned to intellectually authenticate. The greater idea of the need to discipline our thoughts stands. Here those of Hatonn point out that the Creator works _through_ us because It is _in_ us. This divine spark that manifests Its presence might be seen as the key thing separating us from mere thought projections, as we are ourselves co-Creators. But we also create _on the Creator's behalf_, because our nature is inherently the same as the Creator's.

In fact, they go a step further: that the Creator works _through_ us. It is a duty we have not just to ourselves and each other but the planet itself, and indeed we've had some [thoughts](https://har.center/category/topics/thought-forms) from the Confederation not too long ago speaking to this directly. We don't create the entire creation as individuals as such, but we do create our portion of the Creator's experience of that creation. This is why I often claim that our most Creator-like quality is our thinking, our attitude towards the aspects of the Creator we encounter in our illusion.

Finally, I really appreciate their reminder that we are cooperating with other co-Creators in this collective thought form work. We extend our creatorship not through simply disciplining ourselves but also in coordinating with other co-Creators to realize more and more powerfully helpful thought forms. To the extent we are the Creator, fourth density is entirely in our hands in precisely the manner and sense that has been ordained by ourselves/the Creator.

> My friends, to define the Creator is, for any being, incomprehensible. Yet, to begin to understand Him is indeed within your, shall we say, ability. Each and every individual, as we are aware of it, is nothing other than a projection of a pure thought from that source which we call the Creator. Each thought has taken upon itself forms of personal identities. In an essence they vacillate upon that same, shall we say, spiritual cycle of existence.
>
> If it is true, that your existence has been brought about through none other than the thought of the Creator, and if it is true, as it has been stated in your holy scripture, that man is created in the image and likeness of his Creator, then therefore it is true, my friends, that your thought brings into existence the creation in which you live.
>
> My friends, you have been given this opportunity, this live experience, in which to learn many lessons. And you have been given all of the abilities of your Creator for within you, He is. And working through you He shall always be. And with these abilities you truly create the experiences that you have. Not only in this life but in all existence upon all levels.
>
> There are certain, what you would call, laws that are undeniable and unbreakable. Yet, it is your choice. It is your choice in which directions to go and what creations you wish to experience. It is necessary for man upon the planet Earth at this time, above all others that you are aware, to learn to control the thought projections, especially those which are detrimental not only to other individuals, but to your Earth sphere and its environment. Man upon planet Earth, indeed within himself, is godly in nature. You are divine and you have no limitations unless you choose to accept them. Yet, where man upon planet Earth has, shall we say, gone astray, is in the failure to recognize that that for which he searches is within him.
>
> Those upon planet Earth—not all, but most—seek that divine intelligence that they call God. They use the intellect to search for Him in books. They search for Him in dwellings called churches. They search for Him to be working through others. And most often fail to recognize that He is working through them from within them. My friends, it has been stated that the Kingdom of Heaven lies within. And indeed these words are true. Within you is that spark of divinity. And that spark of divinity, shall we say, is a part and particle of the overall construction of that energy which is the Creator. You have not been separated from Him. You are not fallen angels, as some may think. You are creators working together whether you be aware of it or not, formulating the existence that you need.
