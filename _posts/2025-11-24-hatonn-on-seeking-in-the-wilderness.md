We're kicking off [1978](https://www.llresearch.org/channeling/1978/), another year of sparse records of channeling. I rather think this indicates a lack of recording rather than a lack of channeling, because it's hard for me to see sporadic practice leading to narrow band contact in less than three years, but who knows. I really doubt anybody with first hand knowledge of this is still alive, and in any case Ra showed up when they showed up.

Hatonn admits this message is more advanced than usual at the end, and while this comment ostensibly addresses their advice to S in the Q+A section, I think it applies to the monologue as well since it addresses some of Carla's doubts. Hatonn is speaking of the ambiguity inherent in the preincarnative programming. We wander in the wilderness, seeking what is authentic in ourselves through the illusion, and returning to the source within when this illusion has exhausted us. In fact, polarization might be said in many cases intimately tied up in exhausting our appetite for distraction, for having it both ways (seem the Transformation of Mind archetype).

Meanwhile, we have our program available in its original poignance and purity within ourselves, and meditation is our entrance to this resource. Rarely do we understand intellectually what it offers, and in this confusion we have our freedom. In this murky wilderness, we serve as an all-in, blind gamble on the hand of love we hold. Whether this precipitates into public awareness or not, we are operating on the level of faith---faith that the program is good, that we will learn by hook or crook, that the real work is always within regardless of what the world notices, that any seeming choice we make is but the descendant of the single actual choice available to us.

> We are not denying in any way that each personality incarnates into the illusion with one primary, as this instrument would say, program. This program is general and can be applied in various ways. If some ways are blocked, it may or may not be possible to fulfill the program as originally intended. However, it is a frequent thing that those who plan ahead find their plans… This is true, shall we say, of the soul in an infinite sense, as well as it is true that the personality is… The ultimate program for any individual… is completely achievable…
>
> For that goal is simple: it is to be aware of the original Thought, to be aware of love. Whether the actions that are part of, shall we say, the karmic programming, are taking place as planned… the primary goal of expressing the original Thought is always… each individual is free the whole time. Many times it seems there are circumstances [that] are far less than…
>
> An important thing to understand about the interfacing between the ultimate program and realizing love and the action program for one personality in one life experience is this. If the individual continually grounds himself in the original Thought, a condition is thereby prepared for an interface between love and proper action. We have said to you many times, meditate. Meditate and… Do not doubt, distrust or cease in your desire to be of service. As you meditate, allow that desire to keep the vibration, the antennae let us say, of your senses on the finer planes… You have felt that you are in the wilderness, and yet it is precisely in the wilderness that you must be alone, for you have the challenge of being aware of that which is paradise totally within yourself rather than being in the position of dwelling in paradise and attempting to remember the wilderness. We say to you the experience of wilderness is extremely important to growth of what you would call your soul.
>
> As the immortal soul plunges into a cycle of experience such as you have committed yourself to in this density, the darkness of not remembering the Creator’s Thought and all… All senses are stilled. Slowly the wisdom, kept like a seed within the soul, begins to put forth tiny sprouts and through many life experiences those sprouts are encouraged to grow.
>
> In many situations, where there is ease within a life experience, choices are not made on the part of the individual because in paradise the individual grows complacent and does not evaluate all things in the belief of the original Thought. Inconsistency, impurity of motive, causes an interruption in the vibratory pattern of growth. And that particular incarnation serves only as a resting point between other more beneficial incarnations.
>
> We do not ask you or any individual to truly rejoice in feelings of desolation, in feelings of getting off the track, shall we say. And yet we say to you that [with] enough determination, that wandering in the wilderness can one day herald that which is described in your holy works as the voice of God crying in the wilderness to make straight the way of the Creator. When you are struggling to understand, the struggling may seem to go [on] interminably. But then, suddenly the rocky places are made smooth, the mountains are made land. In your outer life it is possible nothing might have happened to cause this breakthrough. It is your inner light that counts.
>
> This [is] why we say that you are free. It is your thought, your choice, your understanding. Trust that understanding. And we ask you again, do not fear the wilderness. Do not fear sorrow, desolation, lack of understanding… All of these things mean nothing. Only one thing matters: that is that you continually seek the original Thought. You can not re-choose what is past. You can choose this moment at all times; to become totally conscious of the moment, to see love, to seek the Creator.
>
> These are inner things. They may not ever be brought into action on the dramatic plane. Some paths are dramatic, some are not. And this is true with all individuals. Those who have dramatic incarnations are those who have chosen a multitude of times; those who do not are those also who have chosen. There is no predetermining… There is only one choice, my friends. The Creator is everywhere, within each choice.
>
> We speak to the one known as Carla also, for she has had many doubts lately as to the validity of her health in this incarnation. The Creator offers to those who wish to serve, the wilderness. Those who serve will [be] forever seeking that which is… My friends, you know there is great joy in the seeking. There is joy in fellowship. And there is joy even when totally isolated from your fellow man. In fellowship… Do not ever… seek out the joy of yourself and the Creator… Love is within you. Joy is within you. And the wilderness is within you. Step forward fearlessly. Paradise is also within you.
