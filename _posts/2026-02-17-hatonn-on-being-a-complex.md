This was a hard one to excerpt because it's chock full of goodies. But I'm going to have to stop mentioning that because as we transition into the 1980s it's gonna be an embarrassment of riches. So let's stop letting Jeremy feel sorry for himself and move right along. I do really encourage reading this one in full though: there's thoughts on the nature of evil, on what families are like on planet Hatonn, what range of emotions fourth density individuals feel, and more. I must also mention there's a big hint about how Latuii's name is really vibrated (and part of the reason why I insist on alternative spelling).

Here I see Hatonn hinting at the fact that we are made up of parts, but that we are something more than that sum. This is the paradox of being a complex: our divisions within imbue us with a way to relate to ourselves dialectically. And yet there is a unity that pervades and transcends that; we are not, as [Ra so eloquently remarked](https://www.lawofone.info/s/54#8), machines so much as _tone poems_ -- in other words, our nature at root is _vibratory_ and as such sublime and indecomposable. Like all growing things, there is a season to our fruition that is not simply about parts and pieces. We have the knowledge within us even if we don't have the forms in our thoughts to contain and mobilize them at will. Luckily, there is a greater will in which our wills move and have their being, and it can put our planetary situation in a greater, more loving context.

If I may be allowed to indulge in a little commentary on just that matter: this nature Hatonn describes strikes me as akin to what [Auxhall was explaining](https://har.center/2025-08-16/richmond/2025-invitational/003/auxhall-on-thought-forms-and-service/) to Richmond regarding thought forms. It is quite possible that the mind, body, and spirit complexes that constitute our individuality are themselves thought forms: standing waves of mentation that have a coherent structure that radiates out to influence the environment. But that doesn't mean _we_, the total mind/body/spirit complex, are merely a thought form, no. For we partake of a greater patrimony: having seven energy centers that not only draw together these complexes but also recapitulate that of the sub-logos and the logos. We are not just a wave; we create waves, and in truth we created the Original Wave of Thought.

> Once there was a gardener. Year after year he planted his seeds and learned much about his crops, knowing which seeds to plant against which, which crops to move so that the land would not be depleted. He knew the rooting of each tree and of each type of grass, and he began to feel very powerful, for he had often been told that he had the best garden in all of his territory. And one day he was asked how his seeds grew, and he began to explain by taking a seed and separating it into its parts. And as he took his knife and separated the seed and showed his students the functions of each tiny part of this tiny seed, he found that he had killed the seed, for much as he would try he could not put it back together. And so he learned that he was not the originator of the garden but only the caretaker.

> My friends, we ask each of you at this time to consider that you, yourselves, are seeds, planted in the garden of Earth. We ask you to understand that you are whole and perfect. It is good to nurture yourself. It is good to understand yourself and to care for the garden that you have created for yourself to grow in. But we of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator say to you, as a kind of gardener, do not separate the parts of you too completely; do not observe so closely that you peel away something necessary for the wholeness of your growth; allow yourself to be, for in that way the instinct that is within you to become can have its way in its own time and at its own pace.

> The sun rises and sets upon your planet 365 times in one of your years, and yet it is in one particular day in which a seed chooses to sprout, in which a flower chooses to bloom, in which a tree chooses to blossom, as has been the experience of each of you in seeing the beauty of the springtime that you are now experiencing. Such beauty is nothing compared to the beauty of the soul, of one who is of a likeness of the Creator, such as yourselves, my brothers and sisters, Therefore, as you observe yourself, allow yourself the freedom to be instinctual, for your instincts are good, and the love which you find in meditation will know how to direct itself as your moments come.

> We are aware that you are interested in the world situation at this time, and we have been monitoring it very closely, for it has been a delicate and dangerous time for many months now. But we feel at this time that there is more of an equilibrium than there has been and that there is [inaudible] that your prayers for peace have succeeded to a certain extent for the present. We do, however, ask that you continue in your constant day-to-day attempts to become a focus for love on this planet, for difficulties of long standing will continue indefinitely. As far as we know, there will be need for your prayers for peace. Only remember that that peace begins within yourself.
