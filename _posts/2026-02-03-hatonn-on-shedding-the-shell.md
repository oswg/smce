Hatonn today provides us a nice, tight excerpt speaking to an important but discomfiting experience in our evolution. The mind complex, as I see it, is very much a complex of multiple faculties, but one crucial facet it brings to consciousness is its knack for introducing and instantiating _constraining concepts_. It is in the mind complex that we appreciate those thoughts that, unlike more abstract and less discrete ideas like justice and peace closer to the sublimity of the spirit complex, are more concrete and bound. The thought _form_ is an example of how mind creates a kind of container for thinking that allows the thought to be circumscribed and worked with. 

So Hatonn's contention that our thinking conforms to a shell that demarcates the range of possibilities of which we can conceive seems very reasonable to me at least, and it is the seeking towards spirit in particular that begins to expose these limits and gesture towards what it might be like to exceed them. This is dangerous, however, because without these constraints we cannot have identity and traction in a familiar environment as we expect. It makes sense that as we sit with finite thoughts and reach haltingly towards the infinite, we would need to redefine that environment and accept the formerly unfamiliar as the new boundaries of our conscious agency.

As Hatonn explains, one day we will be able to blend with all (and they have spoken quite recently of this blending activity) and will have no need of a separate identity. We can therefore think of meditation as a way to sit with the terror of the unlimited; contemplation as a way to consider new boundaries of selfhood. Perhaps we just need to do these "reps" enough to build the courage and strength to be truly fluid, to truly become capacious as the Creator once we have understood ourselves as unlimited and accepted the consequences of that.

> As the sea creature grows [he] becomes too large for his previous shell and creates for himself a larger one. And when in the course of time he again grows, he then creates a larger shell and so on in a beautiful and unending spiral until such time as he has no need whatsoever for any physical vehicle, the consciousness having left his form. Then, my friends, all the shells are empty, having served their purpose.
>
> There are two distinct stages to the development of your mental vehicle. In the first stage it is primarily important that you constantly be aware that in each situation there is freedom, and you are not iron-bound by any restrictions from the outside.
>
> In order to fashion this awareness, it is in this stage necessary that you construct for yourself the larger mental shell, the larger home in which to grow. Each time that you find that a situation is impressing you as limiting or difficult, it is time for inner work, my friend, in which you explore and discover the larger and the most spacious mental atmosphere that is necessary for your balance.
>
> There is a certain point in your development when you will find that you do not need the shell at all, but instead in the vulnerable body of consciousness you may swim out into the waters of the universe and merge with all that there is. In that moment, my friends, you will have discovered that there is no need for any vehicle whatsoever, for all things are one. And as your home is the universe and as all things are one, no protection is necessary.
>
> We are aware that this second stage is for the most part a very distant goal. And yet, we wish you to know that it does exist and that within it is a larger reality which in good time will supersede the limitations and the difficulties of your present state of consciousness. Meanwhile, enlarge your shell, my friends, through meditation, let contemplation open yourself within. For the world without only seems to press in upon you. In reality it’s pressing upon itself and you are free!
