This message from Hatonn seems ordinary and mundane: once again prattling on about love. However, pay close attention to what they are saying about ideals and how manifestation instantiates them without the need for perfect conformity to their template. This is just Platonism in a way, sure, but the kicker is how to take this same thinking and apply it to the power of love underlying all qualities. And then, how does this application realize the harmony we seek, the vibrancy that draws us forward in our seeking?

> Yes, I am love, my friends. You are love. And we are one. To give you a sense of the immediacy of that truth is very difficult and yet unless love is alive and immediate in your experience, you may search forever without truly understanding the object of your search.
>
> There is a tree outside your dwelling, my friends. And on this tree are many, many leaves. And some of these leaves are almost perfect. Their shape is completely symmetrical and their color is beautifully green, as it should be. And there is no mark or damage and all within this particular leaf is perfect. And on the same tree, other leaves have been damaged by insects, or they have grown in a crooked manner, or their coloration is not as it is expected to be. And yet these are not good leaves and bad leaves. For within them, each, is the same perfect leaf, which is not separate from the leaf, as an ideal, but is within that leaf and is the true reality of that leaf.
>
> Or, my friends, you may think that the many, many forms of clouds—some may bring storms and some may simply be the beautiful kind of clouds. Yet good and bad cannot be said of clouds, for they are all perfect in their cloudness.
And you yourself are in essence a perfect version of you, whether your manifestation may be good or bad, within the illusion. The ideal that created you is immediately within you. It is present within you at this time and it is informing and inspiring your every breath. And this is true of all those you meet, no matter what their manifestations.
It seems like a cliché to say this to you, my friends, and yet you will never be free of turmoil until you are able to bring into your conscious experience the knowledge of oneness in love that you can find in meditation. Without meditation, it is not likely that you would ever discover that unity with the Creator that is the wellspring of true love at all. And without repeated seeking of this unity, it is very difficult to advance at any rate in bringing love into your immediate experience.

> But, my friends, in addition to the meditation you need to bring that feeling into your life as you live it, moment by moment. We have said to you before: attempt to form a personal relationship with the Creator, seek Him as you would a trusted friend, love Him as you would love the most beloved friends you could ever have. True emotion that comes from the heart, personal, deep-felt emotion, is necessary in order to bring to your consciousness the realization that in the Creator you are dealing with the single most important relationship of your life.
> 
> Allow the love for the Creator to build and become more and more personal, more and more real, more and more felt. And then, take that sweet feeling and live it day-to-day. Feel the immediacy of that Creator and share it with the people you meet. This is the secret, my friends. If you can approach each person as someone who is the Creator and whom you may be privileged to serve, your troubles will sort themselves out before you. For love is always reflected in love.
