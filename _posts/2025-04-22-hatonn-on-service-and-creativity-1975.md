First, I'll get the headline out of the way: all the people who prefer "service-to-all" over "service-to-others"? Here's your ammunition.

But the more subtle point is the one about how service expresses our nature as the One Infinite Creator in microcosm. Service is the dynamic connection between all the parts of the Creator that realizes their inherent unity. And when we contribute actively to that unity, we are both _serving_ as an other self and _creating_ as the Creator.

> Our purpose is simple, as is our desire. We of the Confederation wish to serve the people upon planet Earth, and nothing else. We have no motive other than to increase your own knowledge and understanding by sharing with you our knowledge and understanding.
>
> For in service to another, inevitably you are serving yourself. For as many philosophies upon your planet have stated, the universe and all that is in it are one being, and no more, with each being and each particle within it being exactly that: one particle within a whole, all united within consciousness and spirit. And through this unification comes about the undeniable fact that service to one is service to all, and to oneself. You, my friends, are the creator and the gods which are spoken of in the scriptures, as is everyone and everything within this universe. Accept separations within your consciousness, and they shall exist temporarily for you. But deny them, my friends, and the ones which you have been accepting for so long shall begin to fade from your awareness. And you shall begin to awaken to the true concept of oneness. And you shall begin to know the truth: that there are no separations.

> We of the Confederation are beings as yourself, with no greater capabilities than what you possess. The only difference between ourselves and those within this room is that we, through our own efforts, and mostly through the use of meditation, have broadened our awareness and experience beyond that which you have done.
>
> We dwell in a dimension, if you wish to call it that, which does not contain physical reality as you know it. In our domain, spirituality and spiritual awareness overwhelm all existence. If you are not within the harmony of the laws of creation, then you are not able to exist within our domain. Within our domain, there is not that which you consider to be negative. All that there is is love and light, love being the physical manifestation of all things.
>
> Love is all things. The Creator is love, and He resides within you. Each time that you express your love, you have created. And each time you pass up a chance to show love, you have also passed up your chance to develop your birthright of being a creator.
