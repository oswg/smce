Not a lot for me to add here, except that there's some very interesting comments through a different instrument this session comparing the conditioning wave to the wave of love. Then they expand upon the nature of love as one of a perpetual giving, a constant releasing, a service that never ends but only reflects the temporary nature of separation and the timeless nature of unity.

> I am with you, my brothers. I am Hatonn. It is a joy to me to see that my words have meaning to you. Your vibrations are known to us. The vibrations of all your peoples are known to us. Your thoughts and your desires are known to us. Your free will is completely preserved, yet you are known to us. It is this knowledge that allows us to be with each of you as you desire us. We feel the desire that quickens within you to know love. There have been many who have dedicated their lives to a love of one kind or another, and for this love a man may sacrifice years and years in a position which he may hate, in order that he may take care of those that he loves. A woman may sacrifice many, many desires in order to nurture her mate and her children. Love seems always to offer sacrifice. Have you pierced the veil of this truth of love, my friends? It is written that the master known as Jesus said, “In order to love Him, we must pick up a cross.”

> My brothers, this is truth: love is sacrifice. There is a further and transforming truth that can only be learned once the leap has been made into love, once the sacrifice has been freely given, not grudgingly, but freely. That which you give is given to yourself. Truer words never were, my friends. As you love, so you will be loved. What you are, what your reality is, is totally a result of your thought. To sacrifice to another is your only way of giving. That which does not cost you anything is not a true gift. To give, it must be infinite; it must be all. It may not be physically of any moment or importance. Yet within yourself, to be a gift it must be at some cost to yourself, and freely given. Then, my friends, you have considered your brother as the master and yourself as the servant. And you are interested in serving your brother. And then, you have found the secret of love. For all of the creation was designed to be of service to each other part of the creation. That which you give enriches you beyond measure—and that which you hold back will strangle you. How often people think that they are poor, when in fact they simply have not given enough away. How often have you been lonely, my friends, when you could reach out and aid another’s loneliness? Do you not know that to sacrifice is to love—and to love others is only to love yourself?

> This is not an easy lesson. We know that. Go back into the silence when you have difficulties, and you will have difficulties. As often as you can, regularly, find love within you. And then, give it away. For you are truly rich, my brothers.
