We come once again to one of these elusive terms in the philosophy of the Confederation: _understanding_, that state which those of Ra [claim](https://www.lawofone.info/s/16#39) is not part of our third density experience. And yet they also [say](https://www.lawofone.info/s/40#3) a density involves "primarily its [corresponding color] ray plus the attractions of the following ray pulling it forward in evolution and to some extent coloring or shading the chief color of that density." So while understanding in total is not our lot in this incarnation, we are attracted to it, pulled towards it, and therefore perhaps it is reasonable to say that understanding is the draw of the next density on our third density experience.

In any case, those of Hatonn address understanding in this 1978 session, and I'm going to share two excerpts that show how two experienced instruments can inflect a concept differently yet harmoniously. First is "H" (likely Hal Price, the one who introduced the Louisville circle to the Confederation channeling technique over half a century ago) speaking of the simplicity of understanding and how counter-intellectual it truly is (using, of course, an intellectual example at first) but how crucial it is to develop. It's not to be developed simply to benefit us, but also to help us discipline and safely control this power within us as co-Creators. This is the area the Richmond circle is exploring through its investigation of thought forms: ways to help us discipline thought and understand ourselves and the planet's destiny.

> Consider, if you will, when all of you attended your educational processes. In the subject that you call mathematics you are often given a problem. And for that problem you must arrive at [an] answer. Consider, if you will, to know the answer is only a portion of solving the problem. For you must understand the problem and the means by which to derive the answer. Therefore, in this situation, knowledge and understanding are two separate factors which commune together and assist you in solving the problem before you.
>
> So it is that man proceeds through his life, knowing many times the outcome of his actions, but not precisely understanding the intricate workings of his actions. With proper understanding, man upon planet Earth could become the god on planet Earth. For indeed the difference between men and gods is understanding. Knowledge you have. It has been a portion of you always. Wisdom is the proper application of that knowledge. But understanding, understanding, my friends, is the knowing when to apply that wisdom. Understanding is knowing how to arrive at the answer. Understanding is the most important ingredient in the overall spiritual growth of mankind. Indeed, you may arrive at certain conclusions and they may be beneficial for you, but the benefit in most circumstances is less to you unless you have understood the workings of these actions.
>
> We of the Confederation have applied many of your years, more than you’ve ever imagined, to just gaining understanding of the universe and the way all things function within it. And we have yet to arrive at the point of total understanding. And we feel it to be true that we shall seek greater and greater levels of understanding for eons to come as we grow within this universe. But as we have progressed in our understanding, we have seen our growth come more rapidly. For, my friends, all life within this universe is very simple, [like] that which you call mathematics. For all thought produces an energy wave and [an] energy wave produces a certain action and a reaction. Each is able to be calculated if you have gained the understanding to monitor, shall we say, these thoughts in a way that you are aware of their conclusion.
>
> We of the Confederation know beforehand what our thoughts and actions will bring about. We understand these things to a great degree even though we have not perfected the application of the understanding that we have gained. It is as with all things, practice is needed. Man upon planet Earth needs to begin to practice. He needs to begin to practice the monitoring of his thought-actions. He needs to begin to practice in understanding knowledge and wisdom. All of these things are greatly enhanced through the process of meditation, which is perhaps the greatest thing that you may practice in your life experience.
>
> But man upon planet Earth presently proceeds to think, shall we say, improperly, thus accumulating greater and greater degrees of misshapen conclusions to his thoughts and actions. And he continues to wonder why. But if man developed his understanding he would know why things are as they are. For he has created them and he, being the creator of his experiences, should accept upon himself the responsibility for those creations and begin to apply understanding. For understanding, my friends, is not only recognizing the functions and mechanisms of your thoughts and actions. Understanding is applying love. For in understanding your actions, you may determine whether they shed love to your fellow man, and if they do not, then we say that your actions are improper.
>
> For whatever you do, my friends, it does indeed affect all mankind. Whether you see that effect going any further than your own personal experience or not, you have placed an energy into your atmosphere. An energy that will never die. An energy that will pass among many people and affect in some small way their own being. So whether your actions be self-centered or directed towards the peoples, you must care and love one another enough to gain the understanding so that you may create for yourself and with others the environment that man upon planet Earth desires.
>
> We understand your difficulties within your society. We understand what may seem to be your lack of knowledge. And it is this understanding that has made us capable of reaching forth to you and sharing our knowledge and our love with you. For we would react much as the man upon planet Earth if we did not understand your actions and your circumstances. For it is the nature of man throughout the universe to question and to even judge that which he does not understand. So consider, if you will, the importance of understanding. Recognize the difference between it and knowledge and wisdom. Recognize the link between the three. And look at the actions and the thoughts within your life and attempt to understand them. Attempt to see their outcome and by seeing this you may gain a greater degree of understanding than you have now.
>
> We of the Confederation cannot do these things for any of you. We can only share with you our thoughts, hope that you accept them and apply them and work with them. And if they prove to be of no value to you we suggest that you refrain from using the knowledge that we give. But we of the Confederation have used our methods for a great length of your time and we have found them to be beneficial to us and we know that they shall bring the same benefit to you if you apply them in your life.
>
> We of the Confederation indeed are not a source of ultimate truth and shall never claim to be so. We are a source of limited truth and limited understanding, ever progressing, as is man upon planet Earth. We are only to some extent more fortunate than you for we have progressed through your present experience and into ours. Indeed, upon your level of existence understanding is somewhat different than upon ours. And it is one of the greatest keys to reaching any upper level that you would desire.
>
> We of the Confederation look upon you and even we wonder at times why you do not see the simplicity of your difficulties. And the answer is immediately within our consciousness, for we [see] that man’s understanding is far behind his knowledge. And only recently, unfortunately, man’s wisdom has begun to flourish. Work on these things and you shall notice a change within yourself.

And finally a short follow-up by Hatonn through Carla emphasizing love's role in this adventure of understanding:

> When as a race you were young and _[inaudible]_, you understood with your physical bodies. The understanding of your heart beating and your lungs breathing and the stimuli to which your adrenal system reacted was your understanding. This was an unbalanced understanding.
> 
> As you climbed out of the darkness of the body, you as a race willfully entered the darkness of the mind. And now you wander as seemingly as very tiny ghosts inside a great _[inaudible]_ computer, caught in endless tunings of switches.
> 
> Understanding, my friends, is understanding of only one thing: the love of the Creator/creation. If, as you see through the eyes of your physical bodies, you do not see the Creator, you have not yet acquired understanding.
>
> Seek it, therefore. To actively seek is to live. Those who do not seek are waiting. For what are they waiting, my friends? For the most part they are waiting for the physical death so that they may remember that they do not want to wait. You already know that you do not want to wait. You are eager for the adventure of understanding.
