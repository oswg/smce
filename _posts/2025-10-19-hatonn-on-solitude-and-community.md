Here's another clip from the same session as yesterday, building upon the theme of self-knowledge but using the lens of solitude/community to illustrate it. Not a lot to add here, but notice how each experience _both_ reinforces the other _and_ highlights the absurdity of each position. These are all experiences of unity and love in various limiting contexts so we can see a richness that full transcendence cannot impart or at least appreciate.

> Within your illusion, although you are in a community you seem to be always alone. And we say to you your aloneness is the key to many understandings. Until you understand [how] to be alone you will never be able to fully be a part of a group. Many among your peoples have the need to be with others and yet they find that they are not satisfied. Conversely, my brothers, it sometimes seems that to be alone would be the most precious thing because one seems to be always dealing with others in your community. Yet, until one is able to share in community, one cannot totally use the time alone. And so it is a circular problem. For to be alone is in the end impossible, for you are one with all that there is. For to be with a group is impossible for there is only one. So you are within the physical. It is a mystery. Yet, through meditation you may find the heart of being alone and the heart of being part of the community. For in both states you are inspired by the Creator and His love which you have called the Word.

> In your solitude, realize first that you are in direct relation to love, and that this love is your whole existence and all else is the appearance of love. In your communion with others, realize that the blessings and the troubles are possible only through the relationship of love between you.
