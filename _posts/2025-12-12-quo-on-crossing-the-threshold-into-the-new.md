The Q’uo principle addresses the Richmond circle members’ concerns about letting go of old situations and stepping into new, unknown ones. Highlighting the archetypal nature of these transitions, Q’uo connects thought forms to the less discrete matters of faith and causality to shed light on the nature of the meandering path each seeker walks. Follow-up questions tackle issues of accepting the self, offering service while suffering from personal handicaps, and the nature of cooperation within the Confederation.
