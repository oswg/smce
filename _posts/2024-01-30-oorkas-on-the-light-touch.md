> Such tragedy we feel along with you. And yet, does it not call to your heart? And does it not ask for your best as a response to it? This instrument understands how deep this despair can go down, how low it can feel when one is disrespected or discarded, how incommensurable an expression of love can feel with the depth of suffering on this planet. And yet, as one learns to balance those tragedies’ reflections within the self, one learns that service is a flow, and it is called out of oneself by outer events.
> 
> It is a process of revealing opportunities, for you must understand, my brothers: you ignore so many opportunities on a moment-by-moment basis. And you offer these opportunities a kind of disdain—not purposely, but out of ignorance. And it will come to pass that you will see the 360 degree nature of this avoidance and come into your own relation with it at some later time, the chain of events and feelings that one upon another lead to what we typically call a “lesson,” an insight, newly discovered, into the nature of your own beingness. This is highly valued by your Creator; not simply the lesson, but the unique way that you, as a unique mind/body/spirit complex, approach it, take it within, and find a balance that no other person can ever achieve.

> Therefore, we would like to revisit a topic that featured in your opening conversation, that of what those of Ra described as the “light touch.”2 It is a way in which one learns how to gingerly deal with resistance, to maturely relate to disappointment, and to keep the mood fresh, to keep the eyes from pointing downward so that new opportunities that otherwise would be missed can be glimpsed and can do their work of inspiring the seeker and drawing out of him or her that irreplaceable spark. And then the current of love, the circuit of life may be completed, and the flow will attest to one’s structure of selfhood more than any reflection, more than any explanation. For to feel truth, my friends; that is an order of magnitude more satisfying than to understand it or to conceive of it through the processes of mentation.
