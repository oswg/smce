In this session, Hatonn speaks about "progression," which they describe earlier through "B" as akin to "walking the path" of spiritual seeking (there's an interesting mention of "swaying side to side" on the path that sounds similar to [Ra's description of the transformation of mind archetype](https://www.lawofone.info/s/100#6), but that's not particularly germane at the moment). The message that follows B's speaks of how to tie that progression to the day-to-day reflection on experience. There's also a great point about what service relevant to analyzing experience, and how it is by yielding to the Creator, not coming up with our own plan or waiting for the world to change, that we find our path to service and growth towards the upward spiraling light.

> We speak to you about progression, for we know that you will progress, for that is inevitable, as all things progress. The only question open is the direction of that progression. There is a quality to experience which greatly aids progression, and ignoring this quality in your experiences will cause your progress to be minimal. Moreover, this quality of experience is one which is often ignored by your peoples, for they do not understand the need for rapid progression nor the technique for obtaining this rapidity.

> Consider that experience, as you see it, is an activity such like eating a piece of fruit. The piece of fruit, being the experience, has an edible part which you immediately take into your system. When you finish with the easily eaten substances you are left with the seed of the piece of fruit, and this you throw away. You must understand, of course, that while the flesh of the fruit will feed your body for a day, if you do not plant the seeds you will not reap the long-term benefits of the living consciousness. In experience, that which you experience at the moment is much like the flesh of the fruit. It may be sweet, in which case you eat it greedily, savoring every morsel. It may be sour, in which case you will not eat it, or you will only eat part of it. In either case, whether the fruit is sweet or sour to the taste, the seed is the important part for your progress. In each experience there is a seed of wisdom, a lesson which was implicit in the experience and which you must plant in your consciousness in order to progress.

> Taking your experiences into meditation is very important; offering them up to the consciousness within you, not in a judgmental way, but simply as a desire that you truly learn from each experience, not just for the day, but for the future of your spirit. On the level of your intellect, it may be helpful for you to ask yourself the following question with regard to your experiences: in this experience, was I of service? In this experience, did I want to be of service? For the seed, as we have said, which will enable you to progress rapidly, has as its key love expressed in action. And the closest we can come to giving you this concept is the concept of service.
>
> Service, as you well know, is not always a thing, but most often an attitude. To be of service is often simply to be non-judging, to be loving, to be willing to see the possibility in another of the Christ-consciousness and its progress in that person. Insofar as you have been able to bring into this experience that attitude, you have already planted the seed as well as eaten the fruit. And as you take experiences in which you have not done this into your meditation even your failures will teach you and the seed will be planted.
>
> The world itself, my friends, will never progress for you are the world. Only you can progress. And you can only progress by offering up your little human self to the Christ Self within you. You cannot influence the world and most especially you cannot influence the Creator. Yet this [is] not necessary, for the world is as darkness and the Creator is light. If you can ask the Creator to influence you, it will be as light turned upon darkness and the darkness will be no more.
