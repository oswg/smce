> My friends, we ask only that you meditate; five minutes, ten minutes, however long you may. Daily meditation, my friends; it is an old story but it does not lose its importance. Life as it is known by your peoples seems very normal. But we say to you, my friends, that the universe is very, very unusual. There are many, many strange things all around you. Many informative, unusual occurrences. To pick up, to understand those things that are missed by so many, it is necessary to tune the mind by meditation.
