I’m traveling overseas so I don’t have a lot of time or energy for posting, but this speaker’s recounting of Schopenhauer’s approach to differentiation is so sublime that I felt it worth sharing. I think it’s also entirely possible that thinking carefully from this place can help one reason about what time/space is, e.g. what would differentiation look like if time were the foundational medium of perception?
