Once again, I think this 1976 session is pretty self-explanatory. Only one thing I'd comment on: their juxtaposition of this UFO mission of awakening interest in infinity with the central role of love. 

It may seem at times, if we consider ourselves to be wanderers or at least attempting to serve others, that either we must have this (for all intents and purposes in consensus reality) dubious affiliation with aliens **or** we must focus solely on loving by more directly  relating to people on their own terms. But this little excerpt shows that we execute on the fancy mission _through_ being more loving in our mundane daily lives. 

Not only that, recognizing and being able to transmute the quotidian fear of life into moments of sublime love strips this UFO narrative of its more dangerous elements, namely the fear that it can evoke. It is in the striking of this balance between the impersonal narrative of cosmic evolution and the personal narrative of love that we find the ability to bob and weave with the needs of those who request our service.

> I would speak to you this evening of several things. First, one thing: you may have wondered, because of the recent increased activities of our craft within your skies, why our messages to you have become more, shall we say, involved not with politics and reasoning about our appearances in your skies, but on the contrary, our messages to you who have meditated together with us, have become more and more on the strictly philosophical or spiritual level. Our appearances are part of the plan which you are all aware of, to alert those upon your planet who are sleeping, in such a way that they will begin to search for a way to wake up.
>
> You, my friends, are already waking up, and our appearances in your skies have served their purpose with you. In the days to come, we will be appearing as much as we can, and hopefully, people will be asking you questions, for they will know of your association with this type of group. And so, we are very, very interested in deepening your spiritual and philosophical understanding of our mission. That is all that matters to us. You are our physical hands on this sphere. We can give you thoughts and advice, shall we say, but it is to you, in the flesh, so to speak, to whom people will turn.
>
> Secondly, we wish to speak with you about the circumstances of your daily lives. Again and again we have suggested meditation. There is a method of dealing with the illusion, by which you can use those happenings which are within the illusion in such a way that they become reality, and are so constructive in helping you along your spiritual journey.
>
> The method for doing this is to remove fear from your attitude towards the illusion. Meditation is a great aid towards removing fear, for if you are confident from your meditation of the fact that all that exists is love, then whatever occurs on the outer planes, no matter whether it is pain, or death, or birth, or pleasure, you will be able to see it for what it is—that is, love—and accept pain and death, as well as pleasure and birth, so that the circumstance which is real upon the outer plane is absorbed into your being as it is, that is, as reality, and not as the illusion which your premature reactions will cause it to become.
>
> Love casts out fear. This has been written in your holy works, and it is indeed true. If you fear any set of circumstances that may occur, you will not be able to see the reality of the love within these circumstances. It takes a good deal of resolute practice to refrain, finally, from fear of pain. But, my friends, on the outer planes, this is what is. Pain and pleasure. Accept both within that stillness of being which is an awareness of love.
