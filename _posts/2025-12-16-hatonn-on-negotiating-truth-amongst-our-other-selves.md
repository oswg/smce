I've been meditating on this passage quite a bit because of personal distortions I have towards other seekers. They really are a reflection of my own embarrassment; others' shallow interpretations (in my view) force me to face my own past shallow interpretations and suggest I may not have the deepest approach now. This material is so meaningful to me that it bugs the hell out of me how flippant folks can be in reading the material (if they read it at all!).

It was only when I started earnestly applying the philosophy to my own life that I saw its true value. That value does not lie in Ra's ability to express concepts with precision and erudition. It does not lie in the story they tell. It lies with the ability it may or may not hold to transform your life, to transform that person doing the interpreting. It's only working with _your_ material, and deeper study of this philosophy cannot but ride shotgun with the main purpose of studying yourself.

Even if you accept this mantle, so what? You're still going to face the same, untransformed self in other selves. Acceptance, forgiveness, love: these are not one-time events but ongoing processes of life like cell mitosis and heartbeats. With meditation and inner inquiry you land on the shores of a vast continent whose shelf has served as the floor of your identity since time immemorial. It's not even the beginning of the journey: it's simply waking up to the journey you forgot, and no matter how distorted things seem, you are well positioned to exploit the opportunity and serve the Creator.

I don't know much about the Mark-Age Metacenter, but I gather they do some channeling of erratic polarity. But you can apply the lesson to any spiritual information with profit.

> This group has had its temptations with what some have called lower astrals in the past and has channeled false information about landing and other natural phenomena. However, it has managed to understand what was occurring and not try to justify its mistake. Due to this, this group manages to dispense, shall we say, a fair amount of our so-called cosmic sermonettes without too much distortion. What you must do in dealing with information such as Mark-Age Metacenter is learn to separate the wheat from the chaff, as this instrument would put it. See the truth in that which is given and with compassion allow the channel to make mistakes without you being emotionally disturbed by false information. In fact, my friends, this would apply to all of your established, so-called religions of your planet where the original manifestations of universal truth and love had become clouded by the distortions of men who with their intellect and with the help of lower inspirations have muddied the waters of the original truths. These truths are there and can be recognized. What you cannot use and do not need, discard. Do not become emotionally upset if others have an emotional need for what you consider distortion. Allow them their path to understanding while knowing that it is not your path to understanding. There are infinite numbers of beings, each with his own path, each with his own recognition of truth.
