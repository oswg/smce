This one hits home, very similar to my all-time favorite Hatonn of May 1, 1983 where they speak of communication as only giving and not taking, how persuasion and making points is completely beside the point of the love that gives communication its import. I have a tendency to be stimulated by conflict; it fires off seratonin or something in my head. I have an intense sense of loyaty for my friends and love nothing more than going to battle for them. It is love, but it is mixed with something quite self-serving and reaffirming to my personality.

But there is no point to make. There is no battle to win. There is only love, and if we focus on the love content of the communication rather than the details of the communication, we will be able to touch that light within others as the Creator has touched our light at our center.

> Light, my brothers—imagine yourselves armed, completely covered with an armor of light. The light is so bright and so white, you are so radiant, that no one can look directly at you. You shine like the sun. It is not possible for any harm to penetrate that armor of light, nor is it possible for any harm to leave your mind, your heart, or your hand through this aura of light. You are protected from within and from without.
>
> There are many, many times, my friends, when in your fear you attempt to use your armies, those little armies of soldiers which you call words, and you send your words and your mean actions and your petty emotions out like little soldiers to combat those little enemies, those people about you who seem to be sending their soldiers against you, saying and doing things that make you unhappy. You feel that you are vulnerable to them and so you fight back, shall we say, with your little army of words. And you become disturbed and excited. You are not yourself, in the sense that you are no longer a light-being, but a small, dark animal fighting for its position. You have lost the grandeur and the majesty of that within you which is pure light and pure love and you are reacting as a weak person.
>
> My friends, you need no armies, you need no intellect. You need no fights, for you are completely protected by light.
> 
> _[A pause, during which the wind roars against the windows of the house.]_
>
> You are aware, my friends, of that which is a great disturbance in your outer environment, and we use this to tell you these storms within your emotions may seem just as difficult, just as dark, and just as terrifying. If you feel anger, if you feel discomfort or, my friends, those of you who were with the group in this afternoon meeting, those of you who felt the slightest need to, shall we say, defend yourselves against someone who did not seem to understand—you were not seeing this person, my friends, as a light being, to whom you should give love only. You were seeing him as someone to be convinced, his army against your army, words against words. Love and light, my brothers, my sisters, need no words, but only a simple radiation, a radiation from within of the love and the protection from all that may be without of your armor of light. Never, ever, sell yourselves short. Never let yourselves become in need of that army, if you can possibly remember who you are and what protection you do have. You may play, instead of from weakness, from a position of great strength. The love lies within you, the light shines through you, and there will be nothing which love cannot conquer.
