This is a weird thing I just discovered in session 34:

> 34.8 Questioner: What part do what we call birth defects play in this process?
>
> Ra: I am Ra. This is a portion of the programming of **the mind/body complex totality** manifested in the mind/body/spirit of third density. These defects are planned as limitations which are part of the experience intended by the **entity totality complex**. This includes genetic predispositions, as you may call them.

I don't think I ever really caught that in dozens of rereadings. I've heard of the [mind/body/spirit complex totality](https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?q=mind%2Fbody%2Fspirit+complex+totality&amp;st=phrase) which those of Ra [describe](https://www.lawofone.info/s/37#6) as an infinitely complex thought form left behind by the entity as it moves into seventh density. I'm assuming the "entity totality complex" mentioned above maps to that; if it doesn't, I have no clue about the distinctions. 

But session 34 is the only mention of a "mind/body complex totality". Since the question revolves around bodily distortions, maybe this totality is a expressly second density inflected version of that infinitely complex thought form? I'm speculating, I have no idea. Anybody have any insight here?
