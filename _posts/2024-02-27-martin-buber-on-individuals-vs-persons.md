>Individuality makes its appearance by being differentiated from other individualities.  
>  
>A person makes his appearance by entering into relation with other persons. The one is a spiritual form of natural detachment, the other the spiritual form of natural solidarity and connexion.  
>  
>The aim of self-differentiation is to experience and to use, and the aim of these is "life," that is, dying that lasts the span of a man's life.  
>  
>The aim of relation is relation's own being, that is, contact with the Thou. For through contact with every Thou we are stirred with a breath of the Thou, that is, of eternal life.
