This is a great example of the tidbits of Carla's Christianity coming through in useful ways that augment the Confederation's philosophy and give the Christian spin on the "shepherd" archetype a twist. Where does the compassion to serve others come from? When is the "imperfection of ambition" warranted? When is too little seriousness bad -- and when is too much bad? All in the course of four short paragraphs, Hatonn via Carla gives us much to consider.

> I am Hatonn. I am now with this instrument, and for a brief time I will speak using this instrument. We speak to you once again because there are things which we wish to say to you that do not apply to all those who are in the larger group. For always, my friends, there are various peoples at various levels of understanding. And we do not speak beyond the ears of those who hear, for that only breeds confusion.
>
> To you we speak of shepherds. For truly, you may look upon your little world as being made up of those who need care, and those who may do the caring. We speak to you of the compassion of the shepherd. Where does the compassion come from? What will inspire you to the compassion of the shepherd with his sheep?
>
> We ask that you remember that the universe is not deadly serious, but rather is a universe of love and joy, of lightness and laughter. It is not necessary that you be so deadly serious that you insist upon absolute compassion within yourself. It is enough, my friends, if you accept a certain lighthearted desire to pretend, shall we say, to be somewhat similar to a compassionate shepherd. You are not attempting to fool the sheep into thinking you are compassionate. You are attempting to fool yourself, from a condition of illusion to a condition of reality. You know, my friends, you cannot bludgeon yourselves into this state of shepherd. Yet you must shepherd yourself, gently and coaxingly and with humor. You may act similarly to that which you would consider to be compassionate and slowly you will discover that you are not acting. But allow yourself that imperfection of ambition which is within the illusion. For you are learning, my friends.
>
> What differentiates you from the sheep, then, who are also learning? There is a broad line that cannot be crossed by sheep, and that line is the desire to know. Sheep will be led, and if they are lost, they must be found. But the shepherds, my friends, have desire to know, in order that they may serve. This desire of yours, to know the Creator and to serve Him—this desire is all that you need to be upon the path of the shepherd. Follow it in joy and humor, for being deadly serious will cause you to stumble.
