This is a session that made a big impression on me as I was formulating my own personal style of applying Confederation information to my life. There's really a lot here, and for this post we're going to focus on Hatonn's opening points. I'll probably post other excerpts from this session as they're nice and self-contained.

Probably the biggest idea to clock is this one of service not representing simply the will of the individual to respond to need, but service as a means by which the universe regulates itself and evolves. There are passages in the early transcripts--particularly those channeled by Don--that really nail this: all portions of the Creator serve all other portions. The natural systems, cycles, and processes we observe are simply _service rendered at different levels of awareness_.

This is why there is an intelligibility to all of these tiny slivers of the Creator's whole. The same intelligence we use to see patterns in nature is operating at the level of physics, biology, geology, etc. The only difference is the level of awareness observing and participating. After all, we know well there are higher density phenomena percolating into our third density awareness, but since we don't meet that level of intelligence in our present awareness, it passes our notice. As a side note, this is an area where the Richmond circle is focusing lately, as earth healing seems to involve some kind of intuitive tapping into higher and lower levels of awareness to shuttle the energies through these levels smoothly. All of our focus on thought forms arises originally from Oorkas's suggestions on how we may help with "planetary survival;" e.g. the survival of a planet and the collective unconscious it represents _along with_ the collective conscious to be realized by the social memory complex the individual humans will form. 

The only other thing to emphasize is the way this naturalistic model of service correlates to a built-in sense of _duty_ on the part of Confederation members. Their freedom is in their commitment to serve, for their yoke is light once they can set aside planetary squabbles and focus on what feeds their hearts. So they have plenty of time to prepare themselves for the moment of service; this is where we could learn a thing or two! For not every moment is of equal potential, and when we negotiate the moment's opportunities to heal and serve, we will only be working with the balance we've been able to achieve up to that point. This applies both to the individual and to us collectively, and Hatonn implies there will be even more asked of us as a people in the not too distant future.

> We of the Confederation have sought through our meditation, through our service to mankind, to fulfill a long goal which we had set for ourselves eons of time ago: that is to know and understand the Creator and His universe. It seems but yesterday that we began, and it seems that we will never end in our quest for this knowledge. Yet each step of the way we find relief, we find happiness, in knowing that our understanding has grown and knowing that our love has been multiplied. We of the Confederation share with you, above all things, our love. But there are those among your planet who will not accept our words of intellectual understanding. Yet, we are free to send them our love and our assistance for as they would call upon their Creator, whatever that belief may be, they call upon us. For we have realized that we are also a portion not only of the creation but of the Creator.

> We of the Confederation admire this group, for though you have seen your difficulties in your personal lives and within the life of the organization called Eftspan you have grown and we have grown by watching you and being with you and serving you. We wish [you] to understand that the day will come when you must be willing to freely offer your assistance in a much more demanding way than you do now. And in order to do this properly you must prepare yourselves by becoming the being that you desire to be: one of knowledge and wisdom, love and understanding, one of strength and integrity. All of you have desired this and in some ways you have gained portions of your goal.
>
> Yet, we and all of you must understand that there is never time, as you would call it, for you to neglect the attainment of goals you have set for yourself. For man upon Earth lives within an atmosphere or an environment which is attuned to the premise of time. Your physical bodies are sustained for only a short period, therefore when you neglect the seeking and the fulfillment of your chosen mission and goal, you neglect the entire essence of this short span you live upon planet Earth. You live not for frivolity or enjoyment. You live for love and enlightenment, for the fulfillment of your role in the creation of a perfect universe. If your actions are attuned to the consciousness of the Creator, your life shall experience no difficulty, not in essence. It may appear that you do indeed have difficulties, but they are lessons. Some are difficult, others are not. Be not discouraged by your own lack of disciplines. Be not haughty about your achievements. For you are as others, all others within this universe. You are a creator, you are a part and particle of an undividable growing and consciousness universe.

> We of the Confederation share these thoughts with you and commend you for what you have achieved. We also wish to somewhat warn you that you must realize that your journey has only begun. Be more determined, allow yourself not to falter. Be not discouraged with yourself when you do.
