In today's excerpt you'll see Hatonn build on a theme where meditation and its role in root identity of the mind/body/spirit complex plays a central role. In this session, Hatonn begins by telling a story that captures the role that love and the free giving of the authentic self constitutes service-to-others, and not just service _to_ the other but service in a way that is truly satisfactory to the servant. The secret is to recognize that it is not _your_ individual love and it doesn't come from your individual self at its purest and most refined.

This means we might newed to think differently about service than the normal usage of the term implies. Is service merely a way we score points in the polarity game? Is it simply a matter of helping the other in the manner they require? More and more, fellow seekers, I see service as the actionable way that we experience this cosmic or ontological love of the Creator _in the illusion_. Service gives us a way to feel into the contours of this love, and perhaps this is the entire purposes of the "[incarnative experiential nexus]()" in the first place: to make the Creator in Its totalizing glory meet the unique conditions of the moment in a way that we can appreciate and about which we may give report back to It.

After all, that's an important part of any instrument: not simply to give its user a way to interact with a domain, but also to transmit feedback. I believe it is in the witnessing, this ability to look with love on any situation without averting the eyes, that we might participate most meaningfully in this project. This is how we realize we cannot own the Creator, capture It in some way that validates the instrument, but only give ourselves more and more to our divine user. We then work with _our_ instrument on a moment-by-moment basis to give this project meaning sufficient to let us abide in the mystery of those spaces between finite and infinite where we find the plan.

> Where is the Creator, my friends? Can you touch Him? In your senses, those things which are not seen are not understood. Yet, so it has been always. Had you all been blind you would have thought very differently. But we ask you, my friends, where is the Creator? Is He outside of the world as you know it? Is He unknowable in any way? If so, why would we seek to find Him? My friends, the Creator is in your brothers and your sisters and yourself. Closer to you than your breath, more available to you than reasoning, more heartening to you than your dreams. That which is beyond doing and dreaming is love itself.
> 
> It has been written in your holy works that a man who is kind to another is not kind to a man but to the Creator. You cannot be kind to a Creator that is invisible, infinite, untouchable, unknowable; but you can be kind to those about you.
> 
> You can allow yourself to be a channel for love, whatever your circumstance. Sometimes the circumstances you face are so difficult that you may wonder if there is such a thing as love. And if there is love, is it given equally to all? If it has a plan is it, shall we say, just?
> 
> But we say to you that, as far as we know, the Creator has a plan that has been worked out between love itself and that higher part of yourself which you call your spirit. In meditation you become able to communicate intuitively with that part of the creation that is a combination of the finite and the infinite; in this junction lies the plan. Whatever difficulties you may be having, they can be met with love; and the more deeply committed that you are to finding, feeling and freely giving to others the love that is in every situation, the more quickly you will become what you might call a conscious being, controlling your destiny, improving the harmony, aiding the vibration of your life.
> 
> You cannot possess the Creator. You cannot possess yourself. You possess only one thing: consciousness, and you possess it in common with all that there is. That which created this consciousness is love. Thus we ask you, allow love to flow through you. Not your love but the love of the Creator, for yours will run dry very quickly and you will find it reflected all about you. People, themselves, are reflections of you. Allow this reflection to be one of love.
