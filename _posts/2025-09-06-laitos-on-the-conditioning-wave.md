The conditioning wave was previously discussed in [this 1974 session](https://www.llresearch.org/channeling/1974/1110) which we [addressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofone_philosophy/comments/1jh77rs/laitos_and_hatonn_on_the_conditioning_wave_1974/) about six months ago. This wave is typically dealt with in our philosophy as a subjective signal of contact to an instrument. However, it's worth mentioning that those of Laitos see it as a much broader transmission of helpful love that can occur completely outside the channeling context. 

In fact, they even go one step further than, essentially implying that _meditation's ultimate goal is contact with one's higher self_. Think about that: does that not place all channeled contact in a very interesting context, especially given that we know all contact with outer planes complexes occurs through the higher self? For those of you interested in making contact, I hope you'll consider that a group isn't necessary: only the seeking in meditation.

> I am Laitos. I greet you in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. I wish to speak briefly with you, my friends, about the energy that we do send to you. Each of us in the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator is here for one reason only, and that is to send you our love. We do this in many ways: we speak with you intellectually through channels, we send to your planet as a whole our vibrations of love, and to specific groups and individuals, when they request it, we send a type of energy which has sometimes been called the conditioning vibration or wave.
>
> This conditioning is one of several types of carefully beamed vibratory energy which we can send. We prefer to send this type rather than the more physical types of energy which have been used for some channels, which involve actual physical control of instruments, because other types which involve control are somewhat uncomfortable and because we do not feel that it is as important to give you specific information as it is to give you total freedom as a channel to choose at any time that which you wish or do not wish to receive.
>
> Our conditioning wave is a wave which is designed to enhance your own meditative spiritual wave. As we have told you many times, my friends, you are very much like a radio, in that your brain is capable of receiving and sending on various frequencies of electromagnetic vibrations. These frequencies vary from what would be called lower vibrations of energy to the higher, finer or more spiritual vibrations. We enhance the vibrations that are comfortably within the spiritual realm, so that you can pick up in a much stronger sense the spiritual thoughts that may be coming to you from various spiritual sources. We, of course, are not the only voices on that particular wave-length, as you might say. You yourself have a higher self which may wish to speak with you at any time, especially when you are in some doubt as to your course of action. It is difficult for a person to come in contact with his higher self in a conscious manner. The most common way for one to become aware of his own higher self is for one to dream, and then, upon awakening, interpret that dream. Many communications are had in this way. And yet, meditating, you tune into the spiritual source closest to you, which is your own higher self. You have guides, my friends, such as you would call angels, watching over you. This has been said in scripture and is indeed true. You have not ever been, and will never be alone. You truly have those who care for you on every plane of existence.
>
> You may tune into the brothers on this same length. This is the vibration which we send to you. If you do not wish to become a channel, there are still many uses, as you see, to this vibration, and we send it very gladly. You need only request it mentally. If you receive the vibration and for some reason it is uncomfortable to you, request mentally or aloud that it be discontinued and it will immediately be discontinued, for that which you desire is above all things important to us.
