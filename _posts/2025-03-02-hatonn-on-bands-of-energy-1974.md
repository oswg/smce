As a chaser for that last session where Hatonn said "don't think about densities," Hatonn here essentially bring densities all up again, at least in the sense of those sub-densities Ra [mentioned](https://www.lawofone.info/s/17#39). It is, I suppose, a good way of roughly locating particular kinds of desire in the spectrum of humanity out there, as well as a means by which one can, perhaps in retrospect, see one's location oneself. It's interesting as well to see graduation through these subdensities as in part about exhausting the lower energy to make room for the higher.

To me what is key here is the universal thread of desire that runs through all of this, especially how that maps to the movement of the "universal mind" both in promoting transmutation of energy as well as arresting it. One way of viewing incarnation is the recognition of all of these different sides of the Original Desire. Therefore, as in past sessions, Hatonn makes a kind of equivalence between the fruits of experience and the fruits of meditation that cannot possibly be considered too exactingly.

> We were speaking, my friends, of the many, many inhabitants of planet Earth whom we cannot serve at this time for they do not wish our service. Why is this, my friends? What is it that has brought you to this meeting and has left others with no desire to seek and to know the truth? What is the great choice-maker? My friends, it is not an easy concept to understand, the concept which answers these questions, however, it is an extremely simple concept. What you know of as energy or consciousness or love is extremely wider spread in its definition than you can imagine. The vibration level which forms the density which you now enjoy, has a lower and an upper limit. There are infinite varieties of vibration within this finite vibration level. And those who are at present upon this planet are existing within many, many of these various vibratory levels.
>
> Within the lower vibratory levels, my friends, there will be an excess of certain types of energy, which express themselves in aggressive and energetic action. These types of actions are often seen among those very people who do not wish our aid. Gradually, one begins to use up, or shall I say, transmute some of this expression of energy and another type of energy begins to manifest, for energy is never destroyed, as you already know.
>
>The higher levels of energy have a somewhat less physically energetic aspect and the intellectual aspects of vibration are begun to be experienced. After a certain amount of experience within these vibrations, the energy manifested in these vibrations is used up or, shall I say, transmuted again to a higher level of energy. The catalyst for this transmutation of energy in all cases is either experience or meditation. Experience is an extremely sure but somewhat slow-moving type of catalyst. The transmutation of your vibratory level from the lower to the higher forms of vibration will be one with the movement of the unitary mind of all of those upon this planet.
>
> It is possible to speed your progress within this vibration by means of contacting the creation that is within you. And it is this that we have been attempting to guide you to. Each of you, my friends, is attracted to that which we have to give you because you have in the past managed to accumulate enough experience within this vibration that you are vibrating at the level at which your desires are attempting to satisfy themselves by moving into the higher vibrations of spiritual seeking. You have traveled far, my friends. It has been a long journey. You have an infinity of traveling to do yet, I assure you, but, my friends, the lessons are good. We are indeed sorry that we cannot be of aid to those who have not desired such aid. They will desire this aid in good time, my friends, and we or our brothers will be there to aid them for this is the plan of the Creator.
