This was a hard session to excerpt, because it hit interesting topics all over the map. They talk about the meaning of their name; they talk about disharmony in seeking groups ("Never be disheartened by apparent disharmony, for there must be friction before something can move"), they talk about discovering the unknown and its relationship to love, and more. They even have an instrument pronounce their name differently. The topic I want to single out is that of simplicity as recounted by a social memory complex in the density of light or wisdom.

The experience of a life full to bursting with different details -- some urgent, some trivial; some hidden, some screaming at you -- has always perplexed me as a seeker. It seems like we have to constantly make our lives more complex to be adults apprehending the world soberly, and what is the seeking life but yet another layer of duty and attention to be plopped on top of a stack of distractions, chores, worries, etc.? This is why we meditate: to reconnect with the simplicity of existence, if for just a moment. To my way of thinking it is crucial to learn how, as we discussed in an earlier session, to remove the details -- as crucial as it is to re-assume the duty of honoring them in waking life. As we learn to simplify and relax, we can learn to not only have a productive relationship with the chaos of life and love but also to begin reevaluating the relative import of these details.

Toward the end Latuii discusses the freedom we grant ourselves when we recognize that, just as we have chosen our patterns of life, others have chosen theirs. It doesn't mean we do not attempt to serve. It means that we honor the goodness, no matter how it looks to us, of where we are. Our service then becomes not some crisis-laden rescue mission but the extension of an opportunity to another, same as healing is an offer to the other to heal themselves, not an imposition of healing in spite of the other's free will. Remember that service is not about _you as a personality_ serving, and it's not really about the other personality receiving some aid; it's about participating in a creation that is genuinely one. Service is just the nature of that relating between parts of the one.

> As we look upon the peoples of your planet we see them multiplying the details of their lives in much the same way it has been written in your holy work known as the Bible. When they were in the temple, money changers sold many items that could be bought for sacrifice. Imagine, my friends, the noise of the trading and the bleating, the chirping of the sacrificial birds, the clinking of coins as they passed from hand to hand, the confused penitence of those who came to the temple seeking to find in themselves something that they had lost, something from which they were separated, seeking to find love and wholeness in the knowledge that they were one with the Creator who loved them.

> To choose an image from another of your cultures, imagine the jewel inside the many petals of the lotus. How tightly are the petals closed, my friends, about the jewel of love within you? How much do you have to peel away from your life before you come to the singular and single essence of truth that is all about you? Love is everywhere. It sings in the wind, it sings in the trees. In the season which now approaches, it will sing in the burgeoning greenery and blossoming beauty of your natural world. And within your heart, my friends, do you truly need so many details to lie between you and that same simplicity of being that lies in knowing that you are one with love, that you can give love and receive love and receive love without shame and without stint, that whatever your mistakes, whatever your difficulties, you may turn from them in a moment as you would turn from any error and be fully one with love?
>
> There is no process involved; there is no learning or wisdom involved. It is so simple that we cannot express it, and yet we ask you: throw the details from your life at least once a day. Remove the petals from the lotus, charming as they may be and as delightful as they may smell. Find the holy ground. Find the jewel, that which is love. Upon this ground you can stand without fear of falling, losing your footing, or being cast away from your place, for this is your birthright. Love is what you are. What you think you are, if you think you are not love, is an illusion, a mass of distorted detail that can be slowly weeded or quickly weeded from your life—as you would weed from a garden those things which were not pleasant or helpful—by the process of meditation.

> We realize that each of you is looking for help in finding a way to this simplicity, for truly that culture in which you now live does not promise this simplicity, much less deliver it. We realize that the temptation is great to listen to those who teach, those who prophesy, and to allow them to have influence over you, but we ask you to monitor all things that you hear, read and see, including our words, with a finely-tuned discrimination of your heart, for you yourself are the most stable thing in your universe.
>
> There is a pattern within you which can be fulfilled in many ways, but there are shortcuts. There are easier paths and harder ones. Outside influences may confuse you, or they may enlighten you. You must discriminate, and we urge you to do so, as we say, especially with our words, for we do not mean to influence you but only to inspire you to do your own work on your own precious and immortal being, for we are brothers to you in love, and we hold our arms out to you in love.
>
> Where we are is a very light place, and the nature of light is such that we can see the simplicity of which we speak. Therefore, we are not wise to speak of this simplicity; we are simply stating the obvious. But as you go forth in the world, my friend, it will be wisdom to you, as people ask your opinion, if you can plant the seeds of simplicity, kindness, and all the qualities of that one understanding union with the Father, which is love. Plant those seeds, taken from what you would call the heaven world, into the soil. And do not be concerned whether they grow, for that is not your business. You merely respond when asked.
>
> We are also aware at this time that many of you are concerned about others, and we ask you again to remember that each person has a pattern for their life. In many cases this pattern has not been revealed to the person, due to his lack of meditation, or due to the necessity for the pattern being hidden in order that a lesson may be learned. Thus, if you are concerned for another we encourage you to feel at one with the person for whom you care, to feel at one with love and light, and then to allow that unity to flow.
>
> The essence of freedom is to know that the pattern has been freely chosen by each being, is being given a chance to reveal itself to that person in its own way. Within the illusion that you call the physical life, you cannot tell what is good and what is bad, for the lessons are many, and often what seems to be a difficulty is in fact a prelude to a great learning and a great happiness. Therefore, trust in the pattern of each unique being, and trust that we are all connected, unique as we each are, in total harmony of being, so that our patterns flow together as do the waters of the sea, each atom changing and flowing until one becomes all and all is one. Yes, you are unique, but you may let the bubble burst upon the wave of your being and merge completely with the unity of all and still be unique. You cannot lose this uniqueness. Therefore, allow the beauty of the patterns in the great tapestry to emerge, treasured and loved by you, given their freedom by you, whether you understand or whether you are only trying does not matter. All that matters is that your attitude is that of love toward yourself, toward others, toward the planet on which you dwell, and toward the creation of which you are a part.
