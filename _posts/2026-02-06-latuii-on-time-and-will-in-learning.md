As another example of fourth and fifth density contacts anticipating Ra's messages, consider this passage offered by Latuii. R, a frequent circle participant, is asking about something called "[neurogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenetics)" which I know nothing about and I'm willing to bet my fortune that Carla didn't either. Like any good Confederation contact, Latuii penetrates the transient husk to get to the sublime core of the concern expressed by R. 

To stress the role of will in these matters such as learning and reprogramming the the incarnation is a very novel hint; it shows us exactly what the day-to-day task of balancing between the stillness of spiritual seeking and the frenetic motion of the worldly life. It is in that balancing that the humor or light touch is so needed. Carla's persistent ill health is used as an example of not only how these lessons work, but what learning them actually entails.

> **R**: Am I barking up a dead end… when I was talking to Carla about the concept of healing through neurogenetics?
> 
> **Latwii**: We are aware of the question. To speak of barking up the wrong tree is impossible when there are a forest of correct trees. However, it must be understood that there are a million ways to approach the problem of imposing the perfection of the original idea of an entity upon that which has become distorted in your illusion.
>
> One perfectly reasonable method of attempting to create physical perfection, as you would call it, would be that which you have spoken of. However, it must be understood that each case is an unique one, and in each illness or malfunction of emotional, spiritual or mental nature there are lessons to be learned, and there is a process which is known as learning the lesson among your peoples. We find this a ponderous concept. However, we tend to have difficulty with your concept of time, and your concept of learning the lessons is deeply tied up in your concept of time. Therefore, people upon your planet consider that it takes time to learn the lesson.
>
> It does not take time, it takes a focusing of the will. This, however, must be done completely and freely before the new programming is attempted. The one thing that cannot be done is to reprogram before the lesson has been learned. As we said, this can be accomplished either in no time, in a small amount of time, or in what you would call a lifetime.
>
> This particular entity has been learning a lesson and offering lessons to others through what seems to be a physical distortion of the perfection of her nature, and the lessons seem to be progressing well, shall we say. However, we do not understand progress and can only say that she is very close to achieving the point at which she is of such a disciplined nature that she no longer needs a limitation on her activities in order to stimulate the so-called mission that she has come here to perform. Her nature is so adventurous and enthusiastic that she programmed herself before this incarnation a method whereby her activities would be limited so that she could reach the goal of sharing with others those things which she knows upon a certain level, which she would not have been able to concentrate upon had she been, shall we say, working full time, as you put it among your peoples, and dealing with six children which was her conscious programming. Consequently, she was carefully maneuvered around these obstacles to her becoming a guide to others through writing and being. She has now become a being with very little of the lesson to learn. Therefore, it is quite possible that a healing will take place—if not by barking up your tree, by barking up another.
>
> However, we may say that that which you are working on at this point is, shall we say, a seed concept and should be considered most carefully, for it has a good deal of awareness of that which is of a truer nature than most of that which is of an intellectual nature and is written down among the peoples of your planet.
>
> One of the great graces of the one known as Timothy Leary is a sense of humor, which we find absolutely essential for the progression of the soul. We find so often in your culture that seriousness is equated with holiness, and we say to you that this is, indeed, not so and that there is a holy joy which should be connected with constant and unremitting discipline to achieve the perfect balance between joy and the carrying of that which you know in your culture as the cross. It is said in your holy works, “Peace I bring to you. My peace I give to you, not as the world gives to you.” It must be remembered that joy and the cross walk hand in hand. It is not an easy path, but it is a very joyful path, and approached with a sense of humor, each lesson can be reduced to no time instead of a small time, to a small time instead of a great time, to a great time instead of a lifetime, and so on. And, thus, you may consciously take charge of your life and goal.
