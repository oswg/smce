File under "Ra doesn't suggest meditation techniques -- but Hatonn does!"

I even appreciate some of the more philosophical implications of their technique. First: the idea of recognizing the body as the divine self's dip into duality and materiality correlates very well with [what Q'uo explained to us regarding the Significator of Body archetype](https://har.center/2024-11-03/15/quo-on-the-significator-of-body). We are in this world of polarity and separation, but Hatonn urges us to not think of ourselves as _of_ this world. 

Indeed, I really like the idea that polarity calls to the middle point in some way; it is the existence of extremes that implies the balance. And remember that [a center is always inherent in an infinite creation](https://www.lawofone.info/s/82#7).

The most interesting element to me, however, is the part about feeling into the balance of the body _only to release that sense_! It's as if the imbalance draws us into the polarized drama of the illusion, but the balance starts to withdraw us from the illusion. This isn't absolute -- y'all ain't meditating your way out of the world! -- but it opens you up to the true stillness underlying the rambunctious currents of activity that typify awareness for us most of the time. It is once again an example of the mutability of identity inherent in changes in consciousness, and meditation is our ability to tune into these shifts in responsible and incisive ways.

> We would like to begin by speaking with you about meditation. It is a technique that can be approached in endless ways. Tonight, we would like to say a few words about your physical body and its relation to meditation. Become aware, my friends, at this time of your symmetry as you sit comfortably in meditation. Your two legs, balanced. Each arm resting comfortably. Your eyes, my friends—the space between them, just balanced. That which you hear is being received symmetrically, stereophonically, by your ears. And you are in balance, each side in balance. You are a creature, in the body, of this duality—your right and your left. It is a symbol for all to see of the nature of the physical universe: that there are always two sides, two qualities, to be reconciled in balance.
>
> As you rest in meditation now, my friends, become quite, quite reconciled to this two-sidedness of the physical. Begin to sense that point between your two sides, the point of balance, the point of stillness, the point that does not move. In between the two eyes is the point where your sight becomes one. Midway between your ears, you suddenly hear one whole sound.
>
> You, my friends, are not creatures of duality. You simply reside in a physical body and in a physical universe which is of this nature. Therefore, you are under the illusion that you are of this nature. And it is in meditation that you seek knowledge of your true self, which is free from duality. You are not even that point of balance or stillness. You simply reside, in the physical, at that point of balance, if you have maintained a healthy awareness of who you are and that you are within your body but not of it. Many, many of your troubles in the physical arise from the fact that you’ve allowed that center of stillness to be moved by outward events, so that you seem to be unable to regain that balance.
>
> Now--you find the balance of your body, and then release that connection. My friends, do not become so comfortable within your body that you forget that you are actually a stranger to this environment. Your essential being is unified. You not only know what this unity within yourself is, you are this unity. Coming into the knowledge of it is simply a matter of remaining still long enough to begin to know the true self. It is not a knowledge that must be pulled from far away: you are that knowing.

> We are pleased, for we can see that this, shall we say, technique for understanding the way that the body may be relaxed and then moved away from has helped. I will transfer this contact. I am Hatonn.
