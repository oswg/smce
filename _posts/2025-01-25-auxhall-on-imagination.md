I rediscovered in this some of the first hints the Confederation gave our circle about the nature of projection as a fundamental dynamic of consciousness, an ideal that the phenomena of physical radiation and light merely distort. One can see why imagination properly focused with sufficient attention is so powerful: it bridges between the noumenal and the phenomenal which then provides that crucial element out of which all catalysis arises: feedback. That time limits its fruitfulness must comprise at least some of its value and much of its effective power, conveying into the matrix of existence the raw potential lying behind it. It is for just that reason that this is a good example, perhaps, of what spirit complex introduces to the mind/body complex: the ability to use mind not simply to respond to stimuli but to channel intelligent infinity into new forms. This constitutes the double feedback loop of the mind/body/spirit complex: a loop between body and mind, matter and thought, and a loop between spirit and mind, intelligent infinity and the concept of free will/separation that allows for the collapsing of that infinity.

> You must understand, as our brothers and sisters of Monka spoke of last session, the projective nature of consciousness in the illusion. Mediated by time, thought proceeds in an expansive and contractive manner, bringing events into existence that create transformation. Imagination is a kind of projection of consciousness that can provide a translation between the ideal, the potential, the unconstrained expression of the Creation and the constraints of manifestation.
> 
> Mind functions as a mediating layer for this process of the Creator bringing itself into focus. When you use the imagination, you are harvesting, in a way, a deep and abiding principle of existence that you have, let us say, carved out. We give this instrument an image of a miner using a pickaxe to dislodge a precious gem. You have isolated an aspect of a unity and marshalled that vast potential into a form, for one aspect of the imagination is that it must have a referent; it must have something upon which the finger may be placed, as it were.
>
> Once this has occurred, you see the process of manifestation come into view. This then provides a basis for the material world to provide further inflection points for projection to relate to, and the imagination can simply be thought of as this translation layer between the ideal and the concrete, the phenomenal. This noumenal stage is pregnant at all times with energy and vibrance, but because it offers the self 360 degrees of the Creator – that is, the light and the dark – it takes some time for the self-conscious entity to learn how to marshal these resources in a way that realizes the desire. Ergo the nightmare, the unfortunate event attracted to oneself, the idle creation of the mind that does not find satisfactory purchase in the world.
>
> We would leave it here, my brother: that you are all artists. That is the nature of the creative agent of infinity: to bring projections of the Creator into focus, to turn it about, and then, my brother, to release it. For what one purchases with the gift of time must be relinquished into a pool of potential once more, and while the personality may feel loss, this is a golden loss, a bittersweet but somehow apropos relinquishing.
>
> So must the Creation always be. It blossoms into full bloom, the pedals proclaiming the sheer beauty of the many observers, and that moment is precious because it does not last. It cannot last, for it is finite, and its function is to call to the infinite within, to remind the observer of what it [itself] is.
