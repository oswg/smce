We've reached 1979, but it's difficult to remember encountering a more timely message for our current situation. Here those of Latuii speak of how the healing of our planet, our society, and our culture begins with healing ourselves. This message doesn't need much expansion, but I do think it's worth giving an explanation of their monitoring activities they lay out at the beginning.

Hatonn and Latuii frequently mention monitoring tense political situations on our planet during the 70s channeling. Usually they're only observing and sending undifferentiated love/light, so there's no hint of intervention per se. If I'm not mistaken, when these reports of their earthly monitoring began, it was usually prompted by a questioner asking about some geopolitical situation. From what I can tell it grew into a frequent mention as perhaps a force of habit that eventually died off, and it skated on the boundary of transient information as many of the group's (especially Don's) questions did at that time.

There is a similar but more innocent pattern that formed as we head into the 80s with Latuii in particular. They describe at some point being scientists studying the color patterns of our planet's energy. In the early 80s Carla tends to channel the main conscious message and leave question and answers to Jim's channeling, and he usually served as an instrument for Latuii. Carla got into a habit of checking in with Latuii about which colors they were studying, and I see it as a similar point of conversation as this, just a tad bit less flirting with infringement.

In any case, see in this message Latuii imploring the seeker to work on their spiritual health and peace as a function of working on the peace and health of the entire planet.

> I am with you. I am Latwii. I greet you in the love and the light of the infinite Creator. I am in station above your nation at this time—what you call your United States—as a substitute for the brothers of the sons of Hatonn, for they are on mission elsewhere and have asked us to listen for you and speak to you and share our thoughts with you as would they. It is with great pleasure, therefore, that we are here to offer you all that we have to offer. All that we have to offer, my friends, is a very simple thing: we offer love and we offer light. We would offer it in more concrete fashion to your planet if only the peoples of your planet as a whole wished it. But we wish to be of service, and that concept involves precisely assessing and supplying the needs of each of those whom we serve.
>
> There are many among your peoples whose desires we cannot satisfy, or whose desires we do not wish to satisfy, and that is why we have not landed in public places and made ourselves known to you in an unmistakable fashion. But there are many of you who wish precisely what we have to offer, and it is for that reason that we need instruments such as this one to transmit our thoughts to you and to offer you that inspiration that we can and to pour into the circle of your meeting that feeling of love that is our gift to you, the people of Earth.
>
> We ask you once again at this time to work inwardly for peace in yourself, for as you are, so is the world. Each of you upon your planet is the world. In a way, shall we say, a vote is taken at any particular instant in that river which you call time, that illusion that you call time, that locality you call time, and in that instant the amount of peace which each of you beings upon the surface of your planet have within your heart is the peace of the earth. It has never been more important for you to be in peace within yourself or to realize that you are responsible for mankind.
> 
> Your world is angry, your peoples fanatical in many parts of the surface of your planet. Unfortunately, my friends, that which you call religion has entered the picture, and in some cases it is believed that, as you have a way of saying, God is on one side or the other of an issue. My friends, God is on the side of peace, of forgiveness, and of brotherhood. We ask you, in your meditations, to find these virtues within yourself and to practice them as best you can, for the fate of your planet at this time lies heavy in the hands of all of us who have worked so very hard to prepare you for what you are now experiencing—transition into what has been called by some the Golden Age. My friends, the transition has, so far, been more harmonious than had been expected. This was due to the raised consciousness of many of your peoples. We ask you to continue this work. We ask you to plant seeds in others, not simply about us, for who we are is of no consequence, but about the philosophy of brotherhood.
>
> Remember, my friends, that you are not aware in the universe, either as a person or as a planet. And those things which you do as a planet affect your solar system and, in turn, the energy grid of your galaxy. We are all one, my brothers. We ask that you care a little for yourselves, for us, for your planet. Care enough to sit in silence and open yourself to the process of seeking the truth.
