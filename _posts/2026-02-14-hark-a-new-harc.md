title: Hark! A new HARC

excerpt: As our project gathers itself and gets started, we're looking forward to a world where channeling is not just occuring in Richmond, VA and Anchorage, KY. Other channeling circles following the protocols are coming online, and as they gain experience and improve the quality of contact, they will need a place to publish. We could set up a separate site for each circle, but this could eventually fracture the philosophy and possibly even promote competition between circles. What we need is not simply cooperation but a dialogue, vetting each other's messages for quality, accuracy, and polarity as we expand and deepen our understanding of the Confederation's philosophy.

As our project gathers itself and gets started, we're looking forward to a world where channeling is not just occuring in Richmond, VA and Anchorage, KY. Other channeling circles following the protocols are coming online, and as they gain experience and improve the quality of contact, they will need a place to publish. We could set up a separate site for each circle, but this could eventually fracture the philosophy and possibly even promote competition between circles. What we need is not simply cooperation but a dialogue, vetting each other's messages for quality, accuracy, and polarity as we expand and deepen our understanding of the Confederation's philosophy.

Right now we're using GitHub for that. If you've ever worked in open source software, you know GitHub is ground zero for collaboration. One of the means for integrating the work of countless developers into a single, quality product is the [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), a way of tracking new messages, reviewing and commenting on them with an auditable trail, and seamlessly integrating new messages into the site with consistent tracking of categories, circles, contacts, and other metadata. And for those who don't want to be on HARC? We'll make our code available so they can fork it and launch their own repository.

This is a huge milestone for me personally, as Wordpress was never the right platform for a content repository. Eventually I'd like to set up my own git server so we don't rely on a Microsoft product. But for now this is a big leap forward in globally uniting seeking and channeling in the tradition of contact with the Confederation.
