Everything seems to be falling apart, and it seems clear now that, regardless of what political or social outcomes obtain, we are in a moment of decline. As somebody who has spent (wasted) many brain cycles contemplating the state of politics, I cannot ignore the fear inherent in all of this. As things constantly escalate, as indignities and outrages pile one upon another, it strikes deep to my core and shakes up the sense of self I once had.

For Hatonn, this is normal; this is as it should be. Those who across incarnations have been used to a more harmonious, or at least more functional, society -- be that on other planets or historic civilizations here -- are caught in a real puzzle now. We are going to have to reach deep down within and channel capacities of ourselves without the typical feedback to which we are used. So this will be stressful for all of us, no matter how "spiritual" we are.

Yet I also observe that new currents in society always emerge from collapse and decay. This will, however, never be the currents that seem most plausible in the moment; it will always seem more workable to retreat to the past and reenergize what has been. Yet that has led us here. Hatonn speaks of three natures of humans that are involved in this process that has led here, and each of them plays a role. Without the animal, we cannot maintain our anchor in this world in order to help it. Without the societal, our help does not make its way into the mental matrix of possibilities. And without the spiritual, we have no ability to reposition the anchor, to move it as these current change, because we have no vantage point from outside of the self-referential world mind.

As mind/body/spirit complexes who seek to help, we must engage and harmonize these forces within us. By doing so, we affect currents that help the world harmonize. Sometimes it takes some dissonance to get to the new key of the song, but it makes the resolution all the more satisfying, and it is that resolution, we must remember, that draws us toward the new day. As Hatonn says, if we simply remember that this moment in history and life is just another opportunity to express love in purer or more disspated ways, we can give ourselves a way to orient as selves of earth, of humanity, and of the Creator.

> We were saying: many of those who have come into the world by incarnation have experienced in other incarnations a structure in society, as you call it, which was substantially enough different from the structure of society as it is today that there are remarkable and far-reaching conflicts. This is absolutely understandable and reasonable but only so when you understand that the problem between individuals and their so-called society is that the individuals involved do not have experience with this type of structure but with other structures, which are, may we say, perhaps more conducive to spiritual growth than this particular type of structure.
>
> The very reason that many of those have incarnated at this time is because this will be a difficult and laborious incarnation for them, giving them a great deal of challenge, giving them a great goal. Those who are incarnated at this time, those who have incarnated into this density have chosen, not the easy way, but the way that leads to what they feel are greater rewards. For in hardship, lessons are learned much more quickly than in times of ease.
>
> There are many who are here from your own planetary structures, from those known as planets. These people experience in their social structure [inaudible] yet you have understood, in that society, that the center of man’s being is his spirit. It is not so on this planet. It is understood in this society that the society itself, as it touches man, is the reality. And this simple understanding within your society is the cause for all the conflict that you now feel. It is simple, and yet very difficult to penetrate, because, as we say, when you woke up as a child in this world, immediately this world began to inform your mind of its version of reality. Each of you has knowledge within you, for you came into this world with your knowledge intact. You know that this world is not correct in its speaking to you. Yet you have been very frustrated and unable to express this knowledge, because there are no words and it seems sometimes that there are no alternatives. And certainly there is no loophole, shall we say, no excuse. So you can’t ignore the world as it presents itself to you and substitute your own version.
>
> Let us back up to what we of Hatonn would perhaps say reality is. Let us look at society from that point of view. Sometimes it helps to go back to the beginning and then observe that which you see before your eyes. You know that you are as the plants and the animals and that one portion of you is of the earth and will remain with the earth. You know that many of your functions are earthly and that just as the seed grows into the plant and then [inaudible] and the new seed grows and the cycle goes on and goes on. So, my friends, you were once a seed. There are many things that you do that are of animal [inaudible]. And you fulfill your nature at this time. And this is a blessed and correct action, of instinct and of nature and of course as it should be in this world.
>
> Yet that part of you can be laid aside while we look at the next part, which is, of course, your societal nature, that part of you which reacts with the creation of man as your animal nature reacts with the creation of the Father. You react with other men and with the creations of man, that being their ideas, their boundaries, their structures of all kinds. All things which are created in the mind of man, left to itself—that which is created in the mind of man will become more and more complicated, more and more conventionalized, until entanglements become so great that they strangle themselves. This is the inevitable end of mind without restraint.
>
> Many of your kind have come to depend very greatly upon the powers of the mind, and upon what other people say and upon what is obviously the way things are. This phrase within this channel’s mind seems to occur very often. Yet men know their animal nature and they know they are part of mankind through their thought, their speech and their actions. Yet how often they do not pull themselves through the complexity to the simplicity which lies beyond.
>
> For your third nature, my friends, is the spiritual. You come into this world an animal [inaudible] you are spiritual. That which is infinite, invisible, eternal, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. You are that which is. That which is, is you. The body and the mind, if properly tuned by care, may become the servants of the Creator Who dwells within your spirit. This is your proper nature and it is to this end that you came into this rather trying, rather difficult, and rather laborious environment. If you can express what you understand in spirit within this environment, my friends, what a great light you will have to shed upon the world picture.
>
> This is a chance to express love and so move on to further knowledge. It is as simple as that. Your body and your mind are either your masters or your servants. You cannot bully either your body or your mind. They are, properly, very strong. The only way that they will become your servants is if you offer then a master which they recognize. The body and the mind recognize only that divine will which expresses through your spiritual nature.
