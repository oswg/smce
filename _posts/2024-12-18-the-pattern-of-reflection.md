In session 22, those of Ra [state](https://www.lawofone.info/s/22#6) in response to a question about the shortening lifespans of humans as earth's third density continued into the second and third major cycles:

> Thus the shortened life span is due to the necessity for removing an entity from the intensity of experience which ensues **when wisdom and love are, having been rejected, reflected back into the consciousness of the Creator** without being accepted as part of the self, this then causing the entity to have the need for healing and for much evaluation of the incarnation.

This picture of reflection is extremely interesting to me, implying a kind of quasi-physics to the way that love and light might be manifesting in the illusion. I really haven't read the Ra transcripts on my own all the way through in, oh, about a year now. However, in the [Richmond Meditation Circle](https://har.center/richmond-meditation-circle), we are reading a session every week after our meditation, and the wonderful thing is that reading it out loud really slows me down. As a result, I'm catching so many little things, and this information hints at something that contacts in the HARC and Richmond circles, I now realize, also discuss. 

Here's [Q'uo speaking about the spirit complex](https://har.center/2022-10-08/7/quo-on-the-complexity-of-spirit) at the third channeling intensive (I have aggressively edited to stay on the main points) that speaks to a kind of reflection of attention or energy:

> [The mind as a complex] is a reflection of the veiling. It does not cause the veiling: it is a reflection of the veiling.
> ...
> The complexity of mind functions in part to place each level of information retrieved from manifest experience into its proper place in the order of thought. This ordering of thought is a long running affair. It is part of the discovery process of a creation to perform what we might imperfectly and inadequately describe as a mapping. You are connecting levels of significance to each other and seeing which constitute others in this tracing back of love with the tool of light towards those pure thoughts, those thoughts that are round and have depth. 
> ...
> Now, this process concludes, in a sense, when every ingress of spirit into the illusion is conserved and recovered, placed back in its area where it began its life, so to speak. However, there is something else running parallel to this conservation of energy, this recovery of pure thought and emotion.

Furthermore, at the sixth intensive [Q'uo used](https://har.center/2024-11-02/8/quo-on-catalyst-and-experience) this reflection pattern to describe the operation of catalyst and its ensuing experience archetypes across mind, body, and spirit. In fact, they described it in terms very similar to the archetypal dynamics in the previous session:

> There is a secret to the veil, my friends: it is not solid. It is not without its windows, so to speak. It allows through, similar to the quarantine, energies and particular rotations of mental flavors, the possibilities of a kind of programming of the illusion. This programming is very subtle and cannot account for the creation writ large in its physical or even non-physical manifestation. Instead, it accounts for the part of the illusion that is most illusory, this being the perception of same. 
> 
> Through the perception, a given material reality offers an infinite variety of prompts to the co-Creator, and these prompts are paradoxically reflections of the full consciousness hidden away from that seeker. [In a past session](https://har.center/2024-10-14/15/quo-on-traction-and-projection-in-consciousness), we have spoken of a fuller appreciation for the aspect of consciousness that could be called “projection.” In your therapeutic and psychological fields, it has a particular connotation, and we would like for you to hold fast to that connotation as a subset of a more general aspect of mind, which offers egress of these energies into the field of the present moment. Much as a beam of light travels from the sun and does not stop until it abuts an opaque object, these psychic bids, shall we say, find their target in the outer illusion, their inflection point, and then return to their source. They return transformed, my friends, for they have been exposed to the field of the illusion, and in a way that we are not prepared to speak to immediately, have gained a quality that is very foundational to the entire purpose of manifest creation. 
> 
> As carriers of this added nuance, they return, and because they carry this different quality to them, they are no longer passing by the notice of the conscious mind. They are instead imbued with a kind of intelligibility, a kind of call to the recognition of the conscious mind. They have been activated, so to speak, by the nature of the illusion.

It seems also the body complex plays a foundational role in the operation of this inflection. [As those of Ra say](https://www.lawofone.info/s/79#20):

> The Matrix of the Body may be seen to be a reflection in opposites of the mind; that is, unrestricted motion. The Potentiator of the Body then is that which, being informed, regulates activity.

At the sixth intensive, [those of Q'uo build on this](https://har.center/2024-11-01/4/quo-on-desire-and-catalyst):

> Now in the body, as the one known as Steve explicated, you have a reflection. We would build upon this to say that the substrate of reflecting is a kind of indeterminability that juxtaposes itself relative to the emplacement of the body. And here the sacrifice is to recognize what the illusion of positionality and discreteness obviates. It is a kind of negative example of what one desires, and beckons to the seeking self to imagine possibilities of beingness that time and space cannot adequately encapsulate. And it speaks this truth by the very falsity of the denseness of the illusion. And your sacrifice, while illusory, will be poignant, and will be furthermore something tangibly recognized by your other selves, and in this the individual at its peak of uniqueness is paradoxically united with others and transcended. And in this reflection of the mind, you see the infinite possibility of mind paradoxically again. 

Another reflection pattern Q'uo mentions [here](https://har.center/2024-11-02/8/quo-on-catalyst-and-experience):

> What we have sketched out here is an overview of the nature in which experience brings catalysis to fruition and reflects in a more articulated and discrete manner the full possibilities of potentiated possibility. This is a kind of reflection; similar to the way that body reflects mind, Catalyst/experience reflects matrix/potentiation and delivers to the significant self items of interest and perhaps the seeds of the new biases to be accrued, and in due time yielding power: the power that is inherent in an agent you would call a Creator.

There are a couple of ways of understanding what Ra and Q'uo might mean by "reflection." One way is to see it as simply an analog, and this is how I've usually understood it. However, if this inflection of the illusion operates in the way Q'uo seems to gesture towards, then there's the possibility that this dynamic has more to it.

Specifically, another way of understanding reflection is not simply a recapitulation of the original, or even an inverse of the original, but as a winnowing or flattening of the thing being reflected. When we see our image in the mirror, for example, we aren't seeing a three dimensional counterpart to our body; we are seeing a two dimensional image. There's something about the ultimate limitation, perhaps, represented by the physical illusion and the complex that conveys our will into that illusion that seems to dial in, for me at least, what the illusion actually means for the Creator's project. I would say something similar about the catalyst/experience stations relative to matrix/potentiator: the latter is more discrete and approachable by consciousness; the former more abstract and remote.

This is all well and good when we're talking about the body. What intrigues me is that this pattern seems to redound across different levels of the Creator in its Logos, sub-Logos, and further constituents. I can see catalyst working this way, but it's kind of wierd to see the spirit and archetypal energies operating this way. And to return to Ra's first quote: what does it _mean_ that unaccepted lessons are reflected back _to the Creator_?

Finally, what does it tell us about the nature of creation and illusion that it might operate in this manner of inflection? In a future post I'd like to try to work this into the model I've been working on: the orbital theory of consciousness, where levels of awareness/consciousness are always in a kind of "orbit" around a "center", allowing for two vectors of expression/projection that then have two natures of reflection: one vector inward towards the infinite center, and one vector outwards towards the infinite expanse. [For example](https://har.center/2024-02-24/10/monka-on-discovering-a-new-center): 

> So mirroring is a relative phenomenon, and we have spoken in the past of the way in which mirroring does not simply happen as a phenomenon occurring outside of the mind/body/spirit complex. No, for the characteristic of such a center of gravitational love is that it is infinitely small and infinitely large. In its concentricity, so to speak, you see its expansiveness into the infinite void, the plenum of potential reached out to and pulled in. But the point of the center will always be further and further inward. And so, there is a great expanse of mirroring to be done within as well.
> 
> It is as if the sun was itself a system of concentric spheres, each of which can be plumbed, and each of which mirrors back. This is a concept we shared when we spoke of the ability for catalysis to be mediated by an other self with or without that self’s conscious participation,1 for it is the case that there is a center and an orbiting entity in that relation. It is the model of relation that we of Monka most relate to and have attempted to impress upon this circle before. Mirroring without and mirroring within, two ways of relating to the particularity of separation that emerges from this illusion, such that your surmising has correctness to it. Yes, the center will eventually become simply the site of oneness in this model. But that is a long-running affair, my brother.

I'm wondering simply: am I seeing a pattern that isn't there? Or am I forcing the pattern? Or is there some thread to pull here?
