Once again I'm forced to choose between Carla's portion and H's portion in a 1976 session. Carla's instrument is just so much more lyrical and inspiring! This is good advice for those who rightly and rationally look at the suffering and hardship in their lives and question a beneficent Creator. Not only is it beyond our ability to emotionally ground the authorship and purpose of these experiences, but it would undermine the very purpose of the testing this catalyst effects to know that! This is why meditation, patience, and love are keys not simply to happiness and equanimity, but to _penetrating the illusion_. 

What is it about the illusion that is the most illusory? The separation of objects? The rippling and shimmering changes before our eyes that time unfurls? Or the emotional and psychological weight of living in the seeming cage of the body, looking out into a hall of mirrors, none of which look like what you've decided you are?

<!-- more -->

Even though I've chosen this excerpt, I really, really recommend reading the prelude that came through H. I just don't think there's any point doing posts that take more than 5 minutes to read, because you can read the damn archive yourself if you want that (and I very, very much want that for you, too!).

> My friends, you may have asked yourself before this many times: “If indeed I chose these tribulations, whatever was on my mind when I did that? What was my higher self thinking about?” We cannot penetrate the nature of the Creator, nor would we pretend to. And if there is a reason that the white light and perfect love of the Creator was generated into what you have called the Word, so that entities may appear to people the cosmos, we do not know it. Nevertheless, that this is so, we do know. It is possible that, in infinite humility, the Creator offered to all of His infinite parts total freedom to remake that creation. This is, indeed, the option that was before you as you contemplated your entry into the physical illusion before your physical birth.
>
> Before you came into the physical illusion, you were in an atmosphere where thoughts were obvious things, as real to you as the physical objects of your illusion are now. And the choices that you now find so difficult were not even choices. And you asked yourself, if you were put to the test, would you still know what love was? Would you still know how to serve your brother? Would you still seek the Creator with all your heart?
>
> And so you came into this illusion. Perhaps one might think of what is in the mind of this channel: that in your armed forces, parents hope that their child will become a man. Service under these conditions is more difficult, yet under difficult conditions, one developed more rapidly.
>
> And so it is with you, my friends. This was your motive. Whatever else you needed to do while you were here, your basic motive was to penetrate the things of this illusion with your discrimination so that you could see the love and the light, as you would call it, the heaven that penetrates all that there is. In order for you to see those things that are lasting, it is necessary for things not to always go, on the physical plane, perfectly well, for if your day-to-day existence was not at all troubled, you would perhaps be satisfied to live out your physical existence without seeking further knowledge. It is when things become difficult that you seek to know the reason.
>
> My friends, in all space and time, wherever polarity of good and evil exists, those entities which the Creator tossed into the void have forever and ever turned back to the Creator with an instinct that cannot be denied. Whatever entities have attempted, however much separation they have attempted to put between themselves and the Creator, there is an instinct which cannot and will not be denied forever. Perhaps this is, in a nutshell, the answer to the riddle of why we are all aware beings. We are a timeless answer to a timeless question.
> 
> In your tribulation, in your difficulty, know that this is an opportunity for you to discern, to seek out that which will not rust and will not spoil, to unlock from within your heart those feelings which will long exist, while all more petty and mundane feelings pass away. As always, we suggest meditation, for this is the kind of assignment which one cannot do by oneself.
