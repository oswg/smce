These remarks on meditation are sublime, and I'd like to offer some thoughts on some things they indicate. First, it's about identity and its ability to be shifted. All of the cares and worries of our incarnation exist within a context of a specific identity; in other words, they aren't just cares and worries floating freely but only in relation to a _self_ in a certain _awareness_. So we never have to unplug from that awareness per se --- that's the impulse to live the hermit life and just avoid all the catalyst that accrues to the incarnate personality. Instead, we just take a moment to "zoom out" from that identity to a bigger, more expansive "self."

When we are able to do this "extrasociation" on the fly in a controlled way, we get a better glimpse of the functional pieces of the illusion's catalyst, because we've moved from a position of being directly subjected to it to indirectly subjected to it. We then have the opportunity to see it working, to see our waking personalities from a position of remove in which we aren't simply reacting to the incoming stimuli. Hatonn ties this all up with remarks on our spirit's purpose in incarnation and an allegory by which we can understand painful things.

It's never about totally and completely avoiding the pain and discomfort, but it _is_ about understanding the limited domain of that uncomfortable, painful experience. We don't escape it; we offer it to higher and higher portions of our awareness so we don't concentrate it in the waking consciousness where it can _only_ be worked serially and karmically. This is how we redistribute pain across our individual mind/body/spirit complex, I'd argue, so we can learn to do it communally as a planetary social memory complex. This is something Latuii [brought up recently](https://har.center/2025-08-16/2/latuii-on-working-with-pain).

Also really good segments in here that show how comparitively bad Don was at channeling. Look at Hatonn's remarks at the beginning of the session on self-analysis during channeling.

> Meditation is important precisely because it is the key to what you desire. In meditation, as you become accustomed to that contact with the Creator, your identity becomes more aligned with the truth of who you really are. And in that meditation, your universe expands, for you no longer feel that you are boxed in a little room, beset on all sides with that heavy furniture of your mind, which includes your problems, your difficulties, and the biases which you hold on the subjects which are of interest only within the illusion. That furniture melts away, and suddenly you are in a very large, very beautiful, very spacious place, in which the sun is shining, in which there are sweet odors in the air, and in which that peace reigns that you seek.
> 
> We have found in speaking with your peoples that you are most apt to comprehend our meaning when we speak to you in some vivid metaphor, and it is for this reason that we have long understood why the master known as Jesus spoke so often to your peoples by telling stories. And we give you now two of these symbols of our messages that you may perhaps hold with you. We hope that they will aid you.
>
> The first is, my friends, that it is the function of the physical illusion to, as we have said to you, box you in, to make you feel crowded, to press you into a situation in which you feel pressure.
>
> In meditation, you release that pressure by changing your identity. You find that there is a great deal of space in which to play and rejoice. And you find that in meditation you do not perceive the crowded situation that you perceive in your daily life. Therefore, we say to you when you are feeling crowded, pressed by the difficulties of life, take hold of the image of yourself as being a completely free dancer in an infinite space which is filled with light. You can move about; you can view the situation as it really is. You are a creative person; you are a dancer. You do not walk; you dance. You are not in darkness; you are in light.
>
> There are situations that must be dealt with: this is why you are in the physical plane. And yet there are ways in which this meditative state can be brought to bear upon your waking life.
>
> And again we say to you, your spirit came to the physical plane, as you call it, and willingly buried itself in what you may consider to be dust, for it is so written in your holy works. Yet there was a reason. You well know the reason. And if you [inaudible] we ask that you think of how a pearl is made—a speck of sand that aggravates and pains the living tissue, and yet, in its pain, that which is added becomes a pearl. Your spirit may be polished and burnished until it gives light to others and to yourself. This will happen, and that it causes pain is simply the way the process works.
>
> There is nothing physical or, as you would say, Earthly, about your emotions, your pain, or your joy. These are but the outer layers of that which will affect you eternally. That which is one thing on the physical level is transmuted through learning, so that your spirit in its real and true nature is nourished by the very thing which seems to you to be such bad medicine.
>
> These images we offer you to hold in your mind. But know that these are only words, and that meditation itself is and should be your primary link to your Father.
