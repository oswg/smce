This was a difficult one to clip, because the point when on for a while. Notice however how Hatonn connects service with self-knowledge. There's a secret here about the purpose of incarnation: that it's not about simply doing good, STO-style service to each we encounter. It is *through service* that we discover ourselves, our true identity and nature. Because our nature is never totally understood, our service will never end. We simply offer the love we can, send it out into the world, and learn about the self "out there" that teaches us something about the self "in here."

It's a great reminder that service is not something we are merely commanded from on high to do. It is the crucial means of growth, and since we cannot help but serve, it is more like a wind blowing through us. Our actions then reflect and demonstrate how we have modulated that wind and allow us the feedback we need to dial it in. And if you think of the feedback solely as being a matter of us "doing right" or "being punished," you lose the sublimity of the Creator's process and how perfectly your life serves Its agenda.

Also a reminder that "knowing yourself" is the first step in [the tripartite discipline of the personality](https://www.lawofone.info/s/74#11) those of Ra articulate. So all of this service is almost like the platform for the true journey: the acceptance and transcendence of our every thought and action.

>As you journey throughout this life, you shall have presented to you many opportunities. Opportunities by which you may grow and opportunities by which \[you may\] learn and understand the composition and the operation of the universe or of the Creation. My friends, there are laws which are not written in the books of men. There are laws that override all of the, shall we say, cardinal laws of your planet. There are laws which are handed down to the people upon your planet through what you would call teachers. One of these teachers was that person whom you refer to as the Christ. One of the laws, shall we say, that he commanded to his disciples was, “To know thyself.” My friends, if you wish to journey throughout this life and gain from it the greatest benefit, then you must first, above all things, know thyself. Know what it is that you desire. Know what it is that you shall do in order to attain those desires. Know how you react to all situations and leave out nothing. For many times, my friends, when one views oneself, that portion which you would call the ego of man interferes and disrupts proper and fair evaluation of oneself. For the ego itself shall continually seek out, shall we say, the enhancer or the elevation of one’s opinion of oneself. And, my friends, it is not your position to be placed above or below any other individual. It is not your mission to fulfill to be the greater, to be the greater emanation of truth than any other individual. And this is what that portion of you which you refer to as the ego continually seeks after. Recognition of oneself rather than acceptance of one’s true identity.
