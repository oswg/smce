I mentioned this session in passing in a thread, but it deserves top billing:

The presumption of the seeker is that all parameters are to be understood and searched out and that there is trail of wisdom to the stars, a series of questions that will lead one to infinite wisdom. This is not so. Wisdom is born of suffering, dilemma, contradiction and pain. The so-called happy times that you experience within the illusion are useful as randomly as are the difficult times, and the intrinsic value of happiness is quite low.

Indeed, no experience has a great deal of value except as a part of a very large base of information from which the deeper mind may begin to draw intuitive conclusions about the way things are not. Each of you considers the self a fairly long-term, consistent and stable personality. Seekers tend to view the self as a kind of business to be managed—so much of this, so much of that, the proper conditions for growth, and behold: a well-managed and prosperous-looking metaphysical path. We realize that we are not speaking to those who are seeking reasons to commit themselves to the spiritual path, but rather that we are speaking to those who will live life within third density to its end, incarnationally speaking, moving as closely in accordance with metaphysical principles as intuition and reason permit.

Thusly, we wish neither to commiserate nor inspire. We wish to explain to you that you inspire us, for you cannot see any good that you do, nor can you know what you have learned within this incarnation. And yet you struggle onward, ceaselessly valiant, forever spraining your metaphysical ankles and breaking your bones, picking yourselves up, putting yourselves in traction and moving back into your search, your fruitless, hopeless search for a well-ordered, productive, maximally service-oriented expression and manifestation of love.

You seek to create a life. Do you know that you cannot help create life, or that the enormous bulk of that which you create was created before you got your rational hands on it? Did you know, my brother and my sister, and we speak also to our sister, J, that you move in a maze, working not on understanding but on prejudice? What are you seeking to be prejudiced for or against? You are seeking to be prejudiced against happiness and for suffering, against comfort and for discomfort, against social ease and for solitude, against peace of mind and for humble and disquieted thought, against law and for law. You are seeking to tie a knot so complex that it becomes unity, moving through complexity and dissolving. You are seeking the mystery you name but cannot describe and the doors to the mystery open most fruitfully when the attention is heightened, focused and intensified by loneliness, discomfort and suffering.

Would that we could teach those within an illusion to pay sufficient attention while peaceful and happy, for then discomfort and pain would have no spiritual use whatsoever, these being the two-by-fours which are applied to your foreheads by your higher selves in a loving effort to get your attention.
