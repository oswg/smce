Another Latuii banger drops some 47 years ago, this one focusing on thought and intellect and its proper use. We already know we need them to be in balance with the heart and intuition; now we need to also calm the F down and stop being so serious and solemn. There's a place for that, but not when it arises from a fear -- least of all of God!

One of the most crucial passages here is instruction on "finding love in the moment" that is so murkily [described by Ra two years later](https://www.lawofone.info/s/10#14). "If you cannot find it, let it go;" it seems like a cop-out, right? But it's better than tying yourself in knots! This seems like sage advice: to look for love, and in the looking solidify the intention. To engage the self, and to forgive when the engagement does not yield fruit. To direct the intellect and thought, but to not let it direct _you_, for you are something more than mere thinking, though your personality? That might just be made up, yeah.

<!-- more -->

Two more things: First, at the beginning of the excerpt, notice the admonition delivered to _even Carla_ about overthinking and worrying as a result of trying to make good contact. If you are practicing being an instrument, take this to heart. The preliminary steps to contact are really built in the daily practice; by the time you're actually doing channeling, it should be muscle memory and should not require a great deal of intense thought. _But_ daily practice might be an exercise in achieving focus, and that's certainly how I experience it. I allow myself to think when the stakes are low, because a single unrecorded practice contact is disposable. Worst case scenario is I abandon the attempt, for its better not to practice the wrong approach and get into bad habits.

Second, something contacts in 2025 stressed to me: the words will be imperfect. We need to develop the capacity to receive the _communication_ which is mediated by, but not _bounded by_ the words. [Oorkas](https://har.center/2025-05-24/16/oorkas-on-the-path-to-fourth-density-earth) and Monka talk about taking in the message and feeling into its "center": 

> I am Oorkas. I am grateful that you have had patience with this instrument and with our planet’s message, for it has not arrived without distortion, we must confess. Look to the center of the message, not the words. Connect with the center of yourselves and then connect with the message, and you will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff and take the true hope that we convey as we convey it and as we mean it. And this is, again, a skill you are learning with great advantage to all who cross your paths.

This seems similar to what Latuii describes when they say "We offer these foolish sentences in the hope that you will see what is behind them…" With all my love: please take that to heart as we all learn how to relate to these friends.

> My friends, this instrument has been deep in prayer in the last two minutes, for she fears, as always, that she will not speak the words that we give her. We think that this is a perfect example of what makes us laugh at the people of your planet. You are so serious, my friend; you are so sure that you will be able to tell the truth by the use of your intellect.
>
> My friends, it is as though you have great trees growing on top of your heads with their roots very deep inside your brains, and all the while you are concerned about uprooting these great trees with their great and deep roots. You stood out in the rain and let the sun and the wind pour over these trees and nourish their growth.
>
> My friends, why do you worry? Why do you concern yourselves with those things over which you have no control? Why can you not pray and then let it go and act? Why can you not act and then let it go, be it error or correctness?
>
> My friends, the roots of that tree that grows within your brain, that tree which is called the intellect, cannot be uprooted by force. The intellect can only be starved. Stay out of the rain, my friend. Avoid the sunshine. Do not think too much. It is as simple as that. Do not think about not thinking. The over-use of the intellect, the over-seriousness of your people, has held back more spiritual advancement than we can tell you among your people. You who are in the vast minority among the peoples of your planet, you who are the hope of your planet, you who care to know the truth—do not think that you can think your way to the truth. Know that you can only be the truth. You can only act the truth. You can only love, for that is the heart of the truth. You can only be the original Thought, for that is the heart of love.
>
> There is a love that created you. In that love is all light and all joy. Joining it makes you as light as a butterfly. You have no gravity. You do not need to be serious. You do not need to heap blame, or guilt, for your past incorrectnesses upon yourself. Nor need you do it for others in any way, for others are only yourself, [inaudible] in your mind so that you may see yourself better,
>
> Look each person in the face—look yourself in the face—and find love. If you cannot find it, let it go. Wisdom was not ever won in a moment, until the moment comes. Peacefully await that moment. Do not think about that moment or strive toward that moment in your minds for there is a deeper faculty in your heart, and it is called the will. And we urge you, instead, to employ that. Will to know the original Thought of the Creator. Seek and ye shall find. How many times have those who have spoken to you from the Confederation of Plants in the Service of the Infinite Creator said those words, “Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you”? These words are from one of your holy books, and they are true. The advice is simple. It is not, “Think and ye shall find, think and it shall be opened unto you.” But think will. Use your imagination. Use your faculties of hope and desire.
>
> And as you seek, let the journey be one of laughter as well as tears. Let yourself laugh. Let yourself enjoy that which is beautiful in each moment. Do not think too much. That tree in your head, which is your intellect, is very useful if you need firewood; and you do need a certain amount of it. You have a chemical body. You must live in a chemical world. You must make decisions having to do with your chemical personality. And the truer [inaudible] the intellect stokes the decision-making fires. Very well, then. Use it for that. For your spiritual thinking, stop it. Go into meditation with a free heart, not with a free mind. Let your mind do what it wishes. You are not concerned with your mind. Let it tie itself in knots. It does not concern you. It is a tool; it is not you. Shrug it off. Let it be unimportant.
>
> We offer you these foolish sentences in the hope that you will see what is behind them—our desire to hold our hands out to you, our brothers and sisters, for we stand in [realms] where these things are apparent, where love is enjoyed and shared, where the intellect is understood and not over-emphasized. Indeed, we may say your intellect is, by far, greater than ours, for we know what we know by a process of direct intuition. We share one great body of knowledge among us, and nothing is forgotten. Thus, we need not the tree of intellect.
>
> There is a place you can go in meditation that is a better place, my friends, a place in which you can be clean and fresh, new, just born, and free. We invite you to join us, for in meditation you are in a great company of all those in higher planes.
