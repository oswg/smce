"Logoic chain" is a term Auxhall [employed recently](https://har.center/2025-08-16/3/auxhall-on-thought-forms-and-service) to describe how the Logos fractally penetrates the illusion by stepping down in consciousness. While it is a novel term it's just putting a label on what Ra discussed in session 29; that we are sub-sub-Logos to the sun (sub-Logos) which is sub-Logos to the Logos of our sector. There seems to be a link between spiritual evolution of consciousness and this patrimony in the Logoic chain.

The question is: in a creation of uttery unity, what does membership in this chain actually entail? I imagine it has something to do with multiple levels of perceptive agency involved in the Creator's exploration of its own nature. I'm specifically interested in this regarding my studies of thought forms. Auxhall makes a distinction between generators of thought forms and the thought forms themselves, but it seems to me that a lot of what we consider "us" dovetails with the properties of thought forms that they list.

So are what about us is a thought form, and what isn't? In other words, what is pure about our nature as part of the Logos separate from that which attends merely the mind complex via thought forms?
