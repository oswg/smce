A short one here, as Don asks a bunch of transient questions in this last documented session from 1976. Continuing on the frequent Confederation subject of the great power and radical responsibility of one's choice of thoughts, Hatonn affirms our status as co-Creators of this illusion we shape and are shaped by.

> As many of the teachers upon your Earth have told their students, the greatest step towards attaining that which they seek is to bring in focus the discipline of one’s own thoughts and actions. To think properly is to create properly. To think unrighteously is to create havoc within your universe. These laws you cannot transmute. These laws are those which you must live by throughout this existence and all others which you have experienced and shall experience. As those of you here have attained certain levels of knowledge, it is your responsibility to share them when given the opportunity. And it is your responsibility to seek out greater levels so that your assistance can be of more benefit. Yet, it is your choice whether to do so. There is no energy within the universe capable of overcoming, or controlling in any way, your actions. Only you are the creator. You may accept the influences of your co-creators. That is also your choice.
