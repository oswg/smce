It’s often asked on the r/lawofone subreddit how one should go about serving, or how one can know one is polarizing service-to-others. In doing a massive review of the third intensive sessions in preparation for a presentation on thought forms I’m doing today, I found this passage which I think represents helpful sentiments to those asking such questions of themselves and their fellow seekers.

> Now, you might find yourself worried or concerned about your spiritual calling; concerned that if you do not pursue your spiritual calling, you are not adequately serving others or you are not living up to your potential. We hope it has become clear by now that your spiritual calling will pull you along as you wander through your life, without your needing to know what that calling is. If you are attempting to crystallize consciously within your mind a calling that has a particular name and maybe even an identifiable career path within your third density, we suggest that you might be thinking too narrowly about a spiritual calling. After all, if you are living as a consciousness overlapping and sharing in the consciousness of others, if you are living in a willingness to let go of deceptions, despite the inevitability of always deceiving and being deceived, then your spiritual calling will manifest in the way you live your life, whether you know it or not.

> Having said that, if you are asking yourself the question, “How can I further polarize? How can I be of greater service to others?” then the question itself suggests dissatisfaction with the service you have rendered. What is the nature of that dissatisfaction? Have you in fact attempted to impose a concept of service onto your service as it is? In which case, it might be well to find a way of being satisfied. Or, are you disappointed in your own devotion? In which case, it might be that you have been spending too much time thinking about yourself. You might need to devote yourselves to others in moments such as this, to find some opportunity to pull yourself out of your own self-reinforcing patterns of thought.
