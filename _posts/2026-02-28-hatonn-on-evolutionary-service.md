In some of my research for an essay I'm writing on one of Hatonn's sessions, I came across some early explications of the concept of service. What is novel is not the emphasis the early contacts place on it so much as the way Hatonn grounds the phenomenon in an evolutionary telos and what we would normally call "natural processes." The same way Dr. Tyman coined the term "ontological love" to distinguish what we call "love" as humans from the cosmic forces of creation and destruction, I'd like to suggest "evolutionary service" as the underlying philosophical concept that informs what we crudely attempt in the illusion through our activities and intentions. It is the common root of the different manifestations of desire and response throughout the many mansions of our Father. Service is bound up in desire and therefore the calling, all of these dynamics weaving to hold the creation together as an image of unity careening through the evolution of consciousness.

To articulate the character of service as not simply some moralistic behavior to which we conform but as a broader natural law places our third density project in a slightly different light. If we realize we're always serving the Creator in ways that create more or less harmony, we understand why [those of Ra stated](https://www.lawofone.info/s/67#11) that _we cannot help but serve_. Our very lives are expressions of the original desire to return to oneness, and the service we perform in these lives simply addresses itself through the many to the many in an illusory mask of separation. 

This flow of love and communication between parts of the Creation demonstrates imperfectly in time and space the reality of timelessness and the vastness of our true presence. We tap into this flow when we become an instrument of the Creator, giving us third density mind/body/spirit complexes a small hand in the vastness of our true identity that this illusion hides in process and change. Hence we polarize: we marshall our desire to function under a organizating vibration upon which we learn to fix ourselves, and service is simply the way we acclimate to and express  our chosen vibratory pole.

Anytime we puzzle about how to serve, we can look to simpler forms of this vibratory organization in the creation for clues. The manner in which first and second density processes find harmony in interaction, balance, and exchange illustrates the lower bands of the vibration whose higher band we seek to realize in third density service. Service properly rendered is a complete affirmation in the guise of an illusory situation of the true underlying unity of all, a kind of "counter-distortion" that calls back to the thing originally distorted. It is but a matter of imagination, faith, and will to live lives to extrapolate from the lower vibration to the higher vibration of service.

> We are here, my friends, only to be of service to each of you. All of those upon the surface of your planet who desire at this time to listen to thoughts that will be of service to their spiritual development are those very people whom we wish to serve, and we are here for that reason and for that reason only, to share with you our knowledge, such as it is, to reach a hand back down one rung of the ladder, just as those one rung above us have reached their hand down to us.
>
> For so, my brothers, it is. The infinite, universal creation has infinite densities, infinite progressions. And in each progression there is a brotherhood of those upon the same path, those striving towards the same understanding. And as one reaches one higher rung, one of the privileges of learning is responsibility for those below. For we can no longer ascend higher unless we are endeavoring to the utmost to bring those just below us with us. You see, my brothers and sisters, it is the nature of all things within the creation to be of service to the other portions of the creation. Upon your planet, the creation of the Father manifests this service over and over again, in cycles which complement each other, so that your natural growths give forth oxygen that your animals and yourselves breathe, while you give off that which is helpful to the plants. The air itself is a perfect blend so that you might flourish. The rain falls in such a way that that which you need for your survival grows in plenty upon the surface of your planet. All dwells in harmony, in an attempt to be of service to that which is around it.

> To take another example, my friends, it is written within your holy works that the various portions of your own physical body are not separate from each other but are mutually helpful to each other, for the benefit of the whole. My friends, this is true not simply of your body as an entity, but of all that there is in the universe as an entity. The universe is one thing, one complete whole, and all that is in it functions in mutual service to all the other parts. This functioning is in harmony with the perfect love that created the universe. This unity is love and this love is all that there is.

Here we have another broadening of the definition of service in its response to the original desire and its distortions. A unity cannot function; only an illusory creation can. And in a hint at the concept of harvest, I think Hatonn remarks on the service relationship between us as mind/body/spirit complexes and the earth as the latent mind of the coming social memory complex.

> This desire of the Creator was to provide an experience for all of His parts that would fulfill in totality the desire of all of His parts. But since all of His parts have this same desire, then it should be evident that this desire is to serve the other parts. This is how we have interpreted the functioning of creation. This is why within each individual throughout all of the creation there dwells a desire to serve the creation in any way that he can.

> This dwells within each of the people, all of the entities of this planet, for all of them are a portion of the Creator.
>
> It is possible to fulfill this desire. As we have said, the Creator has attempted to provide only good for all of His children. But since all of His children are a part of the Creator, and since all of us and everything is in actuality one thing, then we have this necessity occurring within each individual in all of the parts of the creation, an attempt to serve. This is natural. The planet upon which you now stand serves you. The growth that comes from the planet serves you. Its atmosphere serves you. Its water serves you. The entire creation serves you. You feel the energy from your sun. It serves you.
