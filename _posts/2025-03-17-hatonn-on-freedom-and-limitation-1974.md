This is a crucial nuance to the information coming through Carla and Don's circle in the early days. Notice how they say that they emphasize the real beauty of Creation to beginning seekers, but over time they seek to become an agitator, an annoyance that keeps us from being satisfied with the current limitations under which we labor. This is all in service to waking us up (something Ra has explained they cannot _make_ happen, but I suppose they can help happen if it's already desired sufficiently), but we are not waking up to a freedom of no responsibilities and no stakes. Instead we are waking up to a more demanding version of the same life we know, with an added level of responsibility concomitant with our status as the Creator.

This is what it means to be the Creator, apparently: the freedom to create, and the responsibility that entails inside of the illusion. To be free, we must be _responsive_ to reality and its feedback through the guise of the illusion instead of blissfully ignorant. This responsiveness is in its way love, but you can start to see the focusing, artfully chosen limitations as a creeping wisdom coming into play.

> I am Hatonn. I greet you, my friends, in the love and the light of our infinite Creator. I am here, my friends, that I may aid you. And yet I am here to sting you and to stimulate you, as a gadfly. I am not here to give you comfort, in that I do not wish to put you to sleep, but to awaken you.
> 
> You, my friends of this group, are very close to your desire. You, my friends, are close to the opening. Going through this opening will unite you with your desire, and then, my friends, the progress you will make will be much accelerated.
> 
> But we must wake you. We must help you to become aware not only of the beauty but of the freedom and of the terrible responsibility of freedom.
> 
> It is so easy, my friends, to forget that you are free. Your intellectual minds insist that you accept all of the words and all of the conditions. They insist that you accept hot and cold. And then you accept right and wrong. And that you accept each and every description of your illusion. And yet, my friends, this illusion is a cunning system of limitation. The limitation is designed to produce heightened awareness, strong emotion, and the resultant understanding. And yet, if you believe too strongly [in] the illusion, you will react blindly to it, and you will not understand, and you will not find the freedom, and you will not find your desire. And this is your responsibility, my friends.
> 
> We speak of beauty to those who are beginning, for truly, all is beauty; all is joyful; all is full of love. All these things are true. But they are more than true, my friends, they are actual. And, in that they are actual, there is no beauty, there is no joy, there is only one thing, and that is the Creator.
> 
> And yet, we cannot say to you, that is the Creator and that is reality, for that is a word. We are speaking the very limitations that we wish to bring you past. Your desire is to come past these limitations, so that you may express the infinite and incandescent love and light that is within you and is the Creator.
> 
> And so we are here, in love and in light, to sting you, to stimulate you. For there is peace beyond peace, and there is understanding beyond all things. And these things must be found through the paradoxes of spiritual awareness, through the limitation of all that is a word.
> 
> As you abide in meditation, you will come ever closer to the unity between yourself and your desire. We are here to urge you towards that goal.
