Here's another excerpt from the same session featuring a follow up question to Hatonn's thoughts on mated relationships: _what do those of Hatonn mean by being yourself exactly?_ There are two mentions of "being yourself;" the first deals with the mirroring nature of any experience of other self by self and vice versa.

> When you can look at the pain of a misunderstanding and continue to be yourself in the face of it, then you become as a mirror reflecting that which may help your loved one. Speeches, arguments and inharmonious silences can never be of the help that you can be if you remain yourself.

Notice they did not say that "becoming as a mirror reflecting" would resolve the misunderstanding in your favor. This is not about winning; it's about service. How can you be of service if you cannot give of yourself--to be precise, a self of which you have posession, to which you have earned title, and with which you bravely and humbly go into each experience letting catalyst shape you. As rough edges of the personality are sanded away by friction, you realize that faith orients you in part because it at least promises to align your conscious mind closesly with your unconscious.

This is the service-to-others way: to give the self away knowing fully the depth of the loss, the cost of the sacrifice, and in the process gain the entire creation. In other words, it is a way _to be an instrument,_ not just in channeling messages from the Confederation but so much more. If we consider the proposition that all channeling might simply consist of more or less extreme examples of _attention crossing density barriers_ -- which must be happening constantly! -- then we realize that service cannot be one conveniently selected idea to matter. It is a matter of thinking the service first through imagination and an honest appraisal of any dissonances discovered.

This concept is then expanded upon by this mention of "being yourself" as not simply a way to honestly relate to yourself but also to your mate:

> We answer this question because we feel it is central to all relationships in your illusion, is very active, because you breathe, because you move, because all that you do is in motion. You find virtue in motion. You make lists, get things done. You try to communicate with words and actions. But of all those things, your greatest responsibility is to be yourself. Yes, you are responsible for your mate’s spiritual growth, for that is a special and privileged contact among two souls and the Creator. No, you may not change in any way the path of your mate, but only love and be.

It is not easy for many of us to think about what Carla called "the service of beingness" as perferable to action. It is not intuitive that when a person presents as unacceptable, we not attempt to correct them but instead attempt to correct _ourselves_. Yet the self, as the Stoics pointed out, is the one element in this scenario over which you do have the ability to exercise your will without infringement. When we direct it via the will, we are responsible for being honest, transparent -- for being ourselves -- as well as caring for our mate in spite of our powerlessness to change them whatsoever. When we can see those two activities as emanating from one vibratory intention, we will have an easier time approaching the practice of beingness Carla described.

In Hatonn's response to the questioner, they begin characterizing meditation as a kind of program for indexing our unique vibration and familiarizing ourselves with that purest version of ourselves through that indexing. This vibration would serve as a tuning fork, I would think, for relative comparisons to assess harmony with others, including using comunication. The enhanced ability to recognize our true selves frees us to explore countless transformations of the self, each delivering the distilled learning but potentially annihilating the personality that served as a vehicle by which the whole self completed this journey.

Given past messages about the necessity for action and its metaphysical potency to validate lessons learned within the "incarnative experiential nexus," it is curious that they would discourage action! I suppose just because it's a decision or intention doesn't make it an action, and they do indicate that relying upon the trial and error of the illusion's catalysis is a recipe for disappointment. The key on the service-to-others path is not acting to force our self-knowledge into awareness, but becoming soft and flexible enough to allow these biases or "underlying traits" to disclose themselves to our witness and mindful integration.

> My brother, we would be delighted to talk on this subject, for it is central. As you know, we have asked you many, many, times to spend time daily in meditation. It does not matter how you do it. This instrument has found it best to meditate briefly many times during the day. It works best for her. Other people find it better to spend an extended amount of period in meditation—twenty, thirty minutes, even an hour. This varies from person to person.

> However, there is a vibration which is yourself. If you can remember your high school chemistry, you will remember that each metal has a specific spectroscopic color or group of colors which were the identifying colors or vibrations of that substance. The vibrations of a being extend from the physical into what you would call the electrical or astral and, from there, into the more spiritual realms which are called sometimes among your peoples the devachanic. All of these vibratory rates put together give a specific, shall we say, spectroscopic identification.
> 
> However, you are not a metal. You are not an element. You are, indeed, an element, that is, but not of Earth. You are an element of consciousness, and your color is one of what you would call relative virtue. You are unique, and your uniqueness is eternal.
> 
> In meditation you become one with the Creator and with your higher self, that self which will remain when your physical vehicle is no longer a functioning pile of chemicals, but rather a non-functional pile of chemicals. You will have the same vibration. To get in touch with yourself, it is best to meditate, for to find out who you are by action is a hit and miss proposition, as this instrument would call it. And those who attempt to find themselves this way only find themselves by a process of elimination, by trying something and saying “No, this is not me.” Then trying something else and saying, “No, this is not me.” And if their analysis is faulty, they may miss that which is themselves. 
>
> In meditation you become centered in something that is sure, something that is much more permanent than your physical personality, something which is called among your peoples, character. There are underlying traits that go so deep within your character that you know within yourself that they are not part of your learning experiences. These are clues to who you really are.
> 
> Of course, all of us are basically splinters, shall we say, of the great sphere of love that burst into infinite pieces at the beginning of your universe. So you are, in truth, part of love. But which part? Who are you? Who are you really? This is not a question that is prompted by an egoistic search, a selfish desire to know, a narcissistic hunger for selfhood, for selfhood you have, but to truly know that selfhood is the only wisdom. And from that wisdom comes the compassion, the patience, and the grace to love all of those people who are reflections of yourself. Your mate was drawn to you and you to her because you and she are polarized in such a way that you can reflect each other rather accurately and so aid each other in spiritual growth. You can distort that reflection by avoiding the understanding of who you really are, but in your unconscious you know who you really are.
> 
> Thus, we ask you meditate. Find not only the love within you but that unique and special love that is within you with all of its unique and special gifts. You know that some can give in one and some in another way. On all levels, some can speak, and some can listen, and some can cook, some can sing, some can hold their arms out to children, some can nurture old people, some have the gift of silence and others that of words. When you know who you are, then your gifts will flow therefrom, and it will be a free-flowing brook, one which is not stopped by the distortion of doubt. This can only be done by daily meditation, seeking the Creator Who is the seed and the source of the love that is you.
